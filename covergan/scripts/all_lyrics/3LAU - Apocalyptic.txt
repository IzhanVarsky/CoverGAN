Apocalyptic Lyrics
I cannot believe it
What in the world is happening?
You have got to be kidding
Do you think I'm crazy?
Oh, shit, apocalyptic

This is crazy
Oh, shit
This is crazy

When will this be over?
What am I supposed to do?
This entire thing is a conspiracy
Do you think I'm crazy?
Oh shit, apocalyptic

Oh, shitEmbed
