Burn Lyrics
I'll say the words, I just
Hate that I'm saying 'em first, yeah
What we had worked, I just
Can't watch it get any worse

We got red wine stains on the countertop
But we keep our pain all bottled up
How'd we get so cold? Damn, look at us
We're frozen up, so I'm

I'm gonna let it burn
Even if it hurts (Ooh na na)
Nothing's gonna change until we up in flames
And someone's gotta strike the match first
I'm gonna let it burn
Even if it hurts (Ooh na na)
Nothing's gonna change until nothing remains
It's been too dark to see the light
To see the light we gotta watch it burn

Oh, oh-oh, burn
Oh, oh-oh, burn
Oh, oh-oh, burn
It's been too dark to see the light
To see the light we gotta watch it burn
Tables turned, ripped the
Roses right out of the dirt, ayy
But for what it's worth
I think what's best for us could mean the worst

We got red wine stains on the countertop (Countertop, yeah)
But we keep our pain all bottled up (Bottled up)
How'd we get so cold? Damn, look at us
We're frozen up, so I'm

I'm gonna let it burn
Even if it hurts (Ooh na na)
Nothing's gonna change until we up in flames
And someone's gotta strike the match first
I'm gonna let it burn (Let it burn)
Even if it hurts (Even if it hurts, yeah, ooh na na)
Nothing's gonna change until nothing remains
It's been too dark to see the light
To see the light we gotta watch it burn

Oh, oh-oh, burn (Even if it hurts)
Oh, oh-oh, burn (Burn)
Oh, oh-oh, burn (Woo)
It's been too dark to see the light (See the light)
To see the light we gotta watch it burn4Embed
