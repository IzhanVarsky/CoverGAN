Fooled By A Dream Lyrics
We live and we learn, we dream, then we die
We stop in concern while chances keep on passing us by
We're looking to others and living a lie
Why even bother, all this effort just to get by?
We're placing the pieces, we're playing the game
We watch as it ceases, looking back at what we became
No one is special, we're all just the same
Oh, oh, oh, with all to lose and nothing to gain

There's a line in the sand that you cannot cross
So quench your desire, desire
Don't be fooled by a dream
There's no way that you will get any higher, higher
There's a chance you'll get burned
So it's better to extinguish your fire, your fire
And whoever tells you to go follow your dream
Is a liar, a liar (Liar)

There's no way of taking before we receive
The future we're making is in the fabric we weave
Don't let no one tell you what you should believe
Oh, oh, oh, there's no limit to what you can achieve
There's a line in the sand that you cannot cross
So quench your desire, desire
Don't be fooled by a dream
There's no way that you will get any higher, higher
There's a chance you'll get burned
So it's better to extinguish your fire, your fire
And whoever tells you to go follow your dream
Is a liar, a liar (Liar)

It's not enough, this can't be all, it's not enough, don't let me fall
It's not enough, I won't give up until I climb atop this wall
It's not enough, this can't be all, it's not enough, don't let me fall
It's not enough, you can beat me around
But you'll never see me crawl, you'll never see me crawl

There's a line in the sand that you cannot cross
So quench your desire, desire
Don't be fooled by a dream
There's no way that you will get any higher, higher
There's a chance you'll get burned
So it's better to extinguish your fire, your fire
And whoever tells you to go follow your dream
Is a liar, a liar (A liar, a liar, a liar)Embed
