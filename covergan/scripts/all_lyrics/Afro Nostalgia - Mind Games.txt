Mind Games Lyrics
When you said, you loved me
Wonder if that came from the heart
Stop playing mind games
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind
When you said, you loved me
Wonder if that came from the heart
Stop playing mind games
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind games

The girl I really love, don't even like me
At this point, I'm thinking, I'll probably die lonely
I'm probably not lucky, this love shit not for me
I'm spilling out my feelings, try not to sound corny
But girl, the feelings you had me feeling unusual
Such a beautiful mind had me out of the physical
Spend time to figure you out with no manual
But then I found out the love we had wasn't mutual

Wasn't mutual
Wasn't mutual
Wasn't mutual

When you said, you loved me
Wonder if that came from the heart
Stop playing mind games
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind
When you said, you loved me
Wonder if that came from the heart
Stop playing mind games
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind gamesEmbed
