Muse Lyrics
I'm gonna follow
I'm  gonna follow
I'm gonna follow you
Till the end of time
I'm gonna follow
I'm  gonna follow
I'm gonna follow you
Till the end of time

Shawty is my muse
So don't get it confused
Looking at her move
I just caught the blues
She came to my world
She brought somethin' new
Whatever she asks
You know I won't refuse
I know that you like it
The way that I bite it
So baby fight it (baby don't fight it)
Your body is aquatic
Your vibe is exotic
You cure my neurotics (cure my neurotics)
Born in the 90s
Lovin' the 60s
Monochromatics (monochromatics)
If you 'bout it
I'm 'bout it
Don't question my honesty
Don't even doubt it (don't even)
You glow like the flowers do
You know that I fell for you
No need of a parachute
I picture me and you
Just Like the cameras do
We don't need camera crew
You know what I'm 'bout to do
You know what I'm 'bout to do
