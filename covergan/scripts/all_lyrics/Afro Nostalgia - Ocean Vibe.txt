Ocean Vibe Lyrics
Baby girl let me ease your mind for a second
Know, I'm trynna be the best
Hoping you can see my effort
Wrap you in my arms
Put your head on my chest
No, I don't mean any harm
I wanna love you the best
She said, she feels safe with me
I'm her bullet proof vest
Free birds and we flying
We built our own nest
Guess you're the Empress
I'm tryna impress you
None of my business
Yet I'm trynna invest
I wanna see that pretty face
I think I'm obsessed
I think we need to chill
And We should stress less
Hit you up with a morning like
Hey sleepy head
Hit you up in the afternoon
How's your day going
Hope you're not following where the wind blowing
(where the wind blowing)
It's been a long day
Sit on my lap
Help you relax
Till your mind get stable
Take you up on a journey
That's a real life fable
Let's go!

You're all I need
You are my ocean vibe
You're all I want
You are my ocean vibe
You're all I need
You are my ocean vibe
You're all I want
You are my ocean vibeEmbed
