Just My Luck LyricsLittle bobber in the water
I finally found us a mess to get into
You probably asked if I was really ever anything but ready
For the bait they put in front of my face
But isn't it just my luck
The easier the answer, the more it tears me up
Ooh, I've had enough
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
And if there's anyone that I should avoid
I'm gonna try
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
So if there's anyone that I should avoid
I'm gonna try
For a moment I was making my way to the base
With a chip on my shoulder and egg on my face
And I failed to see the forest for the trees
And that's the reason why I’m outta clichés
But isn't it just my luck
The more of me I give them, the less they give a fuck
Ooh, I've had enough
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
And if there's anyone that I should avoid
I'm gonna try
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
So if there's anyone that I should avoid
I'm gonna try
Well, isn't it just my luck
The easier the surface, the more it cuts me up
Ooh, I've had enough
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
So if there's anyone that I should avoid
I'm gonna try
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
And if there's anyone that I should avoid
I'm gonna tryEmbed
