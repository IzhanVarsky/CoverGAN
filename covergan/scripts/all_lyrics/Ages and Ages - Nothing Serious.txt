Nothing Serious LyricsTake the line out of my head
Repeating itself since I woke up out of bed
Telling me all is either dying or dead
Oh no no no no
I'm hiding the thoughts you probably read on my face
Hiding the fact I feel a little out of place
Hide anymore, I’ll disappear with no trace
Oh no no no no
But I don't wanna give you too much
Or let you know it's shaking me up
I only really wanna tell you enough so you know
It’s nothing serious
Serious
I know there's love in every word that you said
Telling me how I had some miles ahead
But when I look out, my feet are on the same ledge
Oh no no no no
And the only thing normal is it's always so strange
Everyone walking in a million different, million different ways
Where they go, you know I really can't say
Oh no no no no
But I don't wanna tell you too much
Or let you know it's shaking me up
I only wanted to be honest enough so you know
It's nothing serious
Serious
And I'm thinking myself into circles
Even though it doesn’t change a thing
I can’t keep on digging myself into a hole
And I don't wanna tell you too much
Or let you think it’s shaking me up
I only wanted to be honest enough so you know
It's nothing serious
Serious
It's nothing serious
It's not seriousEmbed
