Midnight Lyrics
Always thought I was losin' the race
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Really don't know how we made it here
Never thought I was worth what you give
Never felt quite alive, now I'm livin'
Yeah, you kill my doubts, they disappear

When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around

Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you

And fall right into you

Like a rock, I was set in my ways
Always thought I was too far from grace, yeah
I was numb before, but now I feel
Any problem, we'll figure it out
Any love lost, we'll bring back around
Any broken heart, we'll make it heal
When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around

Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you

And fall right into you (Oh)
And fall right into you

Yeah, when I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around

Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you14Embed
