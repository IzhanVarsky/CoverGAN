One Last Time Lyrics

Out of love, out of touch
But I feel you coming back to me, back to me
Fill the space with your embrace
You already have a part of me, part of me
Won't let, won't let, won't let, won't let
Just sink underwater, I know it's not over
Pull me, pull me, closer, closer
It's you and me against the tide, I need it one last time

It's you and me against the tide, I need it one last time
It's you and me against the tide, I need it one last time


Out of love, out of touch
But I feel you coming back to me, back to me
Fill the space with your embrace
You already have a part of me, part of me
Won't let, won't let, won't let, won't let
Just sink underwater, I know it's not over
Pull me, pull me, closer, closer
It's you and me against the tide, I need it one last time
It's you and me against the tide, I need it one last timeEmbed
