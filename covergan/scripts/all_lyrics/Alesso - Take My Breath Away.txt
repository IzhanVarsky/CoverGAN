Take My Breath Away Lyrics
Burning lights, hang over head
Body high, swimming in my bed
We ignite, we're slipping like sand

Don't you know you excite me like that
When you touch me like that
Got me running right back
Want it, want it, want it, want it, and I want it now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Higher heights to shallow breaths
Holding tight, never, never end
Pull me down to ecstasy
Don't you know you excite me like that
When you touch me like that
Got me running right back
Want it, want it, want it, want it, and I want it now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away3Embed
