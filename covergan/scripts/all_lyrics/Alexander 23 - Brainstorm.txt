Brainstorm Lyrics
How bad's the weather in your head?
Wish you could stay with me instead
You swear to God it's rain
But salt water is rolling down your neck
How bad's the weather in your head?

You say the building's burning down
But I see no smoke down from the ground
You swear to God the stairs are meltin'
But I see they're safe and sound
You say the building's burning down

Oh, where do you go
When nobody knows where you are?
Where you are
Where do you hide
When you close your eyes? Is it far?
Too far to hear me scream?
Where are you?
(Where are you?)

So what would it take for you to stay?
'Cause there's not a dollar I wouldn't pay
But when it comes to this, my money is
Expensive green and white papier-mâché
What would it take for you to stay?
Oh, where do you go
When nobody knows where you are?
Where you are
Oh, where do you hide
When you close your eyes? Is it far?
Too far to hear me scream?
Where are you?
Oh-oh
Where are you?
No, no, no, no, no

Where are you?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Where are you?

How bad's the weather in your head?1Embed
