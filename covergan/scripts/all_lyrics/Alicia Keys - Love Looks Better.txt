Love Looks Better Lyrics
All I, all I ever wanted
Was a dollar and a chance
Find, find what I'm made of
Alright
Coming, coming from the bottom
Better learn how to dance
Find, find what you're made of
Alright

Feel like my love is wasting
Every day, yeah
Get so damn tired of chasing
Every day, yeah
And now it's you I'm missing
Every day, yeah
Every day, yeah
Every day

So can we talk for a minute?
Stop for a minute?
All I wanna do is you
Oh, can we touch for a second?
Be us for a second?
Don't matter what I give it to
My love looks better on you
My love looks better on you
Promise you, baby
Promise you, baby
Hold up

All I, all I ever wanted
Was a city and some keys
Run, run through the street now
Alright

And now it's you I'm missing
Every day, yeah
Every day, yeah
Every day

So can we talk for a minute?
Stop for a minute?
All I wanna do is you
Oh, can we touch for a second?
Be us for a second?
Don't matter what I give it to
My love looks better on you
Promise you, baby

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted
So can we talk for a minute?
Just stop for a minute
'Cause all I wanna do is you

Promise you, baby
My love looks better on you
Promise you, baby1Embed
