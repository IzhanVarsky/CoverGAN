Almost There Lyrics
You used to know me as a shy one
Now I don't overthink it
Like all my problems I don't have one
I'm all grown up about it

Closer to the edge
I was turning red
'Cause I held my breath
Now I found a way
I have better days
Learned from my mistakes

Um, I'm the one, nearly done
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
I'm really close, I've nearly won
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there

Oh
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
Oh
Oh-oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
I've never wanted to be famous
I only do it for me
Like I was meant to be creative
I use my words as therapy

Closer to the edge
I was turning red
'Cause I held my breath
Now I found a way
I have better days
Learned from my mistakes

Um, I'm the one, nearly done
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
I'm really close, I've nearly won
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there

Oh
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
Oh
Oh-oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
Um, I'm the one, nearly done
I'm on the run, nearly done
Oh-oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there

Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
Oh-oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost thereEmbed
