Somewhere in Neverland Lyrics
Say goodbye to the halls and the classes
Say hello to a job and the taxes
The weekends with old friends spilling into 9 to 5 routine
Tell me how you feel over and done with
Like your life is a map with no compass to guide
At the bar drinking way too much
We sing along to "Forever Young"
So here we go again wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy
Don’t you see what you do to me?
I wanna be your lost boy
Your last chance, a better reality
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you’re with me say the word and we’ll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your "everything better" plan
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Somewhere in Neverland

We’ll start a life of the plain and the simple
Of great times with far better people
And weekends with our friends
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth
We’ll talk about how your parents separated and
How you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out
And trying to feel forever young
So here we go again wishing we could start again
Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy
Don’t you see what you do to me?
I wanna be your lost boy
Your last chance, a better reality
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you’re with me say the word and we’ll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your "everything better" plan
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Somewhere in Neverland

So here we go again
Wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy
Don’t you see what you do to me?
I wanna be your lost boy
Your last chance, a better reality
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you’re with me say the word and we’ll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your "everything better" plan
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Somewhere in Neverland
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
