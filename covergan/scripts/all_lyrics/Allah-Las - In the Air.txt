In the Air Lyrics
Staring at the second wind
I've had my share, I've made amends
Not too suave but understand
A blank aura, chameleon

And strangers, they stop and stare
At the odd familiar
Images that can't compare
To the real thing
In the air

We need light, it's far too dark
Open your eyes, don't lose that spark
In no need of decadence
A puff parade of elephants

And strangers, they stop and stare
At the odd familiar
Images that can't compare
To the real thing
In the air
And everybody stops and stares
They say I am not from here
Images that can't compare
To the real thing
In the airEmbed
