Polar Onion Lyrics
A tired assertion
A sordid affair
The record repeating
With no one aware
(Oooooooh)
Does it scare?

Layered like an onion
Cut pole to pole
Left for the vultures
Out in the cold
(Oooooooh)
Is it old?

Caught on a stand
Spotting the scene
Waters will rise
Drowning the sea
I fill my cup
But it's not enough
The tide is high

A casual observer
A room full of stares
A subtle unnerver
Out of its lair
Stuck in a cycle
Foreign to most
Acidic environs
Sicken the host
(Oooooooh)
Far too close
Stuck on a stand
Spotting the scene
Waters will rise
Drowning the sea
I fill my cup
But it's not enough
The end is nigh

Layered like an onion
Cut pole to pole
Left for the vultures
Out in the cold
(Oooooooh)
Is it old?3Embed
