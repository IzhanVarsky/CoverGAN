What Are We Waiting For? Lyrics
Had no plans to show up (Ah-ah-ah)
Was about to leave (Ah-ah-ah)
You came out of nowhere (Ah-ah-ah)
The possibility

Turnin' nothing into somethin'
Oh, I like we're dancin' slow and
I can feel it, feel it coming
I do, baby do you? Woah

How we get this close?
Wonder how far we go
Losin' all self control
What are we waitin' for?
Dancin' until they close
Hold me and don't let go
Don't wanna leave alone
What are we waitin' for?

Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Keepin' me distracted (Ah-ah-ah)
Keep my mind at ease (Ah-ah-ah)
Little loud as madness (Ah-ah-ah)
And focusin' on me, yeah

Turnin' nothing into somethin'
Oh, I like we're dancin' slow and (I like it)
I can feel it, feel it coming
I do, baby do you? Woah

How we get this close?
Wonder how far we go
Losin' all self control (Ah)
What are we waitin' for?
Dancin' until they close
Hold me and don't let go
Don't wanna leave alone
What are we waitin' for?

Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
What are we waiting for?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
I don't know how we got this close
I'm losing all my self-control
Hold on me tight and don't let go
Hold on me tight and don't let go
I don't know how we got this close
I'm losing all my self-control
Hold on me tight and don't let go
What are we waiting for?

How we get this close?
Wonder how far we go
Losin' all self control
What are we waitin' for?
Dancin' until they close
Hold me and don't let go
Don't wanna leave alone
What are we waitin' for?
What are we waiting for?Embed
