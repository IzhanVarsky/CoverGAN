Don’t Cry For Me Lyrics
Jason Derulo

Too young, too fast
Thought I was ready, but my timing's bad, yeah
One life, too much to see
And I said, "Hey, I had better days"
Yeah, I miss that train by a mile away
But please, don't cry for me

If you thought I was down, if you thought I was losing sleep
Well, I'm still goin' hard eight days a week
I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe (Breathe)
Every lonely night are teardrops in the sea

So don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't cry for me, don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, please don't cry, please don't cry for me
Don't cry for me
Bad luck, bad love
I climbed the ladder, it was never enough, no
I'll bite my tongue, I'd say nowhere was wrong
Somebody told me
Somebody told me I was done
I'm still picking up the pieces, and now I was number one

If you thought I was down, if you thought I was losing sleep
Well, I'm still goin' hard eight days a week
I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe (Breathe)
Every lonely night are teardrops in the sea

Oh, so don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't cry for me, don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, please don't cry, please don't cry for me

If you thought I was down, if you thought I was losing sleep (Yeah)
Well, I'm still goin' hard eight days a week
And I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe
Every lonely night are teardrops in the sea
So don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Don't cry)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't cry for me, don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Don't cry)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, please don't cry, please don't cry for me
Don't cry for meEmbed
