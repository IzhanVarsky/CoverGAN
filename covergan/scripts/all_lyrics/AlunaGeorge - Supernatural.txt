Supernatural Lyrics
Is this dead or is it alive?
Resuscitated too many times
I circle it, too many sides
Must be a gift from a future crime

Supernatural, supernatural, supernatural
Make this up for the ceremony
All hands up for the big finale

Is this dream state or awake?
Creative science that we make
The perfect innovation
So close to real we can't tell its fake

Supernatural, supernatural, supernatural
Make this up for the ceremony
All hands up for the big finale

I go interplanetary
Oh, your touch is haunting me
It's so extraordinary
When you're simply holding me
I go interplanetary
Oh, your touch is haunting me
It's so extraordinary
When you hold me
I go interplanetary
Oh, your touch is haunting me
It's so extraordinary
When you're simply holding me
I go interplanetary
Oh, your touch is haunting me
It's so extraordinary
When you hold me
