Forget Me Not LyricsHow could you want this?
I don’t need this
Why do I try when it hurts so bad
Done with the secrets
With your secrets
All the sweetness beneath the scabs
I’m failing
I’m breaking down
Erase me
I’m done
Forget me not
Pull me apart again
Just an afterthought
Right down to the stem
I’m torn to the core
My heart is on the floor
Forget me not
Forget me not
Why can’t you listen?
When will this end?
Burn me alive and do it again
End your hatred, I don’t play dead
Can’t kill me cause I’m in your head
Forget me not
Pull me apart again
Just an afterthought
Right down to the stem
I’m torn to the core
My heart is on the floor
Forget me not
Forget me not

Forget me, forget me not, forget me you can’t kill me
Forget me, forget me not, forget me you can’t kill me
Forget me, forget me not, forget me you can’t kill me
Forget me, forget me not, forget me you can’t kill me
Forget me not
Pull me apart again
Just an afterthought
Right down to the stem
I’m torn to the core
My heart is on the floor
Forget me not
You can’t kill meEmbed
