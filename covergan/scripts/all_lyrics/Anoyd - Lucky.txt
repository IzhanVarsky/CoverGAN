Lucky Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
I been staring at your face, I been staring at your face like

I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call me on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Hit me on the FaceTime we get lovey-dovey
No comparing to your face ma
How I get so lucky?
Even got the cake now
How I get so lucky?
Staring at your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Staring at your face like
How I get so lucky?
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call you on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Yeah
She be lookin' like she from another country
Waiting for the days I be kissing on your tummy
Death due us part, I'ma Tiller no Kentucky
Taking online class, I'ma eat it while you study
I'm always asking God like, "How I get so lucky?"
Even call your ma like, "How I get so lucky?"
Told me "A ladybug landed on you, honey"
But I still be thinking like, "How I get so lucky?"

I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call me on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Hit me on the FaceTime we get lovey-dovey
No comparing to your face ma
How I get so lucky?
Even got the cake now
How I get so lucky?
Staring at your waistline
How I get so lucky?
I've been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
How I get so lucky?
People staring like it's summertime and I got scully
It's no time that my mind go off and needing you every night like my iPhone charger, real
I'm like, "How I get so lucky?"
Happy that I took the time to bag my baby like a cubby
Sweet that I only bear with you if it’s gummy
No sleep thanking God like, how I get so lucky
Even call your ma like, "How I get so lucky?"
Even call your grandma like, "How I get so lucky?"
I need you in tub, baby, like a rubber ducky
And I’m still thinking like, "How I get so lucky?"

I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call me on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Hit me on the FaceTime we get lovey-dovey
No comparing to your face ma
How I get so lucky?
Even got the cake now
How I get so lucky?
Staring at your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
How I get so lucky?
Stuck in a love and I'm lucky
Ladybug in honey
Wanna write "I love you" in your tummy
Hoping they become me
Putting a little oney in your egg like the Easter Bunny
Pray to God, "How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?"
Stuck in a love and I'm lucky
Ladybug in honey
Wanna write "I love you" in your tummy
Hoping they become me
Putting a little oney in your egg like the Easter Bunny

I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call me on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Hit me on the FaceTime we get lovey-dovey
No comparing to your face ma
How I get so lucky?
Even got the cake now
How I get so lucky?
Staring at your waistline
How I get so lucky?

I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call you on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Childbearing is your waistline
How I get so lucky?
Call you on your break time
How I get so lucky?
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
How did I get so damn lucky with you?
Only thing I ever wanted was you
With you I never got nothing to do
And the person that I am becoming is you
How did I get so damn lucky with you?
Only thing I ever wanted was you
With you I never got nothing to do
And the person that I am becoming is you, uh
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
Yeah
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
Yeah
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?Embed
