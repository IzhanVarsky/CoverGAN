Phony Habits Lyrics

Waking up, it's a ritual just to look through you
You almost died last night talking to my friends

Waking up, it’s a ritual just to look through you
You almost died last night talking to my friends
I hooked you up right before I fell asleep, right?
So when I wake, it’s obvious you a hundred percent
I hold you in the sky when I brush my teeth
Don’t need a mirror when I got you there looking at me, uh
Connected is a crucial, I need a question answered—ask Google
And I’m constantly looking for ya’ll approval
On the way I live my life, ya’ll push me one forth of the way
Quarter push like the carts at price right
My head turn every time hearing you alert
I got a plate of food—let me take a picture of it first
When I lay down, I look up to you like I suppose
Only time you piss me off is when I did drop you on my nose
Or when you freeze for no reason, I be yelling in yo face
But I hold yo' home down—we can start over—okay, I’m sorry
I keep you covered 'cause your only glass sweater
Don’t be keeping you safe or remotely as treasure
You ain’t the reason that I crashed my car
Don’t be hard on yourself, I just need to multitask better
Shorty knock you out my hand she jealous
I keep you face up right on the dinner table case you got something to tell me
I’m always checkin your background
You so smart with a twinkle in your eye, who could turn your brightness down?
Shorty said, "Where the waiters in here? I’m tryna purchase."
When I got you in my hand, I don’t be making no disturbance
Shorty argue with the waiters like, "Whats wrong with the service?"
I yell at my 4G like, "Whats wrong with the service in here?"
Before I put her face first in the pillow, I’m a put you face first in the pillow, then you on silent
I can’t have shining on the ceiling 3 o’clock in the morning, that conversation ain’t that important for real
Appreciation for applications you carry got me lost in that other world
No heart eyes—guess I ain’t handsome
With zero likes—guess I ain’t important
Nobody follow back, I ain't gon' be shit in this world
Maybe I got to show ‘em something from my past just to get love, they quick to rejuvenate what you had
But with the same finger scroll right pass like I don’t exist
Not knowing I need that pat on the back to feel like the shit
No filter to human body when it’s vaguely in site
Which is mainly the reason they don’t look the same in real life
And I’m tryna find the coordinates
In that other realm it’s like a tournament
The orders they follow so insubordinate
Forget the cookies with my Chinese, that's less fortunate
You gotta paint the shit that you facing, thats self portrait
Would hate to watch you fall like a ornament made of porcelain
In a realm where they give corny niggas a orphanage, damn
This shit is horrible, this day in age it’s so inaudible
One domino effect all the dominoes
You give me life I don’t break you cause I’m responsible
I ain't find love but I found a charger though, uh
You was never on my rug every night
I made sure my hands gave you a hug every night
But it makes sense, so I can be on you all day
You was cheating on me with the plug every night and it's cool
Still in the car, three minutes away from home
Why you making me tell my friends that I’m home but I’m not yet
I ain’t even on my block yet, at green lights you was making me post like a drop step
Putting others in danger, only care about yourself don’t you?
Vibrating every second so you hail boastful
My head down all the time so I’m so focal
On you making me antisocial
I’m waiting for you to give me the signal
And lately I been feeling assumptions are kinda fickle
And every time we run into a fuckin’ red light
I always see how much of attention that I can give you
And every time I turn on the T.V., it’s only static
I’d rather pick you up then to pick up a holy passage
I wanna shake off my addiction, I’m slowly at it
I guess I’m still in love—who can break my phony habits?
Yeah, who could break my phony habits?
Guess I'm still in love—who could break my phony habits?
Yeah
