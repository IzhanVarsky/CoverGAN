Last Time Lyrics
I moved fifteen blocks away
As you said you needed space
But I know that that's not true
And I know you know it too

They say insanity is trying the same thing
But expecting something new
We must be insane cause
We keep trying this expecting to pull through

We are running around again
Thought that last time was the last time
It seems like it never ends
We are caught in a past life
What a sad sight
I say we are better off as strangers
Then I drink too much and call
Now I'm waking up in your bed
Guess the last time wasn't the last time after all

Now everyone but us
Can see that this is done
So why are we like this
So blind to consequence
They say insanity is trying the same thing
But expecting something new
We must be insane cause
We keep trying this expecting to pull through

We are running around again
Thought that last time was the last time
It seems like it never ends
We are caught in a past life
What a sad sight
I say we are better off as strangers
Then I drink too much and call
Now I'm waking up in your bed
Guess the last time wasn't the last time after all
We are running around again
Thought that last time was the last time
It seems like it never ends
We are caught in a past life
What a sad sight
I say we are better off as strangers
Then I drink too much and call
Now I'm waking up in your bed
Guess the last time wasn't the last time after all2Embed
