The Disease Lyrics
We are the fire in the attic
We are the voices in the static
You have a sickness
And we are the disease
That brings you to your knees

Misery loves the company
Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
And we are the disease, we are the disease

We are the disease
We are the disease

Critical shutdown of false virtue
The viral outbreak to kill the untrue
You are the cancer
And we are the disease
That brings you to your knees

Misery loves the company
Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
And we are the disease, we are the disease
We are the disease
We are the disease
Yeah, we are the disease

We are the roll call of the pursuit
(The misery, the company)
We are the echo of violent truth
(Your apathy feeds the machine)
We are the whisper of the lit fuse
(You're a disgrace of the disease)
We are the voices and we reject you
(And we reject you, and we reject you)

Misery loves the company
Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
Misery loves the company
Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
And we are the disease, we are the disease

We are the disease
We are the disease
Yeah, we are the disease
