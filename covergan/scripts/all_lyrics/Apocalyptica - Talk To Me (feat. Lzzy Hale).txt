Talk To Me Lyrics
Well, I heard
You went out and had a good time, boy
And you found a little fun
And I heard
She looked fine but the timing was wrong
And she wasn't the one
I was at the wrong time in the wrong place, yeah
I had to hear it second hand
Why can't you tell me to my face?

Don't talk to me
Tell me how you feel
Don't talk to me
'Cause I don't wanna hear
Don't talk to me
'Cause all you'll get is silence

And I heard
That everything you do is like one big circle
It all comes back to you
(It all comes back to you)
And I hеard (I heard)
You've gotta have faith in thе way that you are
Now I know that it's true
So I went out and had a good time too
Turned out that I got my riches
'Cause I found someone new
Don't talk to me
Tell me how you feel
Don't talk to me
'Cause I don't wanna hear
Don't talk to me
'Cause all you'll get is silence

Yeah, and now you're talking again
Shut up, sit down
I've had enough of you messing around, boy
Get back, don't touch
Don't you think that you were running too much of it?
There's no defense
For livin' in nothing but silence
Nothing but silence

And I heard
That you tried to call me last night
'Cause you had something to say

Don't talk to me (Don't talk to me)
Tell me how you feel
Don't talk to me (Don't talk to me)
'Cause I don't wanna hear
Don't talk to me
'Cause I prefer your
Don't talk to me
Shut up, sit down
Tell me how you feel
Don't talk to me
Get back, don't touch
'Cause I don't wanna hear
Don't talk to me
'Cause I prefer your silence
SilenceEmbed
