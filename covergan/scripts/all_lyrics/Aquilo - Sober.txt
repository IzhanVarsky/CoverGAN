Sober Lyrics
What is it you're waiting for?
You've got a chance to say it all
Tied your tongue and fucked it more
Glad you're not me
Cornered by your self-obsession
The hardest way to learn your lesson
(Is learning from me)

Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you (show you)
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober

What is it you're waiting for?
You've got a chance to say it all
Get your kicks from someone else
Don't look at me
Take your time and tell me what you're thinking

Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you (show you)
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober
Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're soberEmbed
