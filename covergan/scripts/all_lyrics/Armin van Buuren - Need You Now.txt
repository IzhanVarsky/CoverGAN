Need You Now Lyrics
You're like a wave that's washing over me
You're like a rhythm, take control of me
You're all I want, if you could only see
That it's tearing me apart
When I'm away, girl, are you missing me?
Are you aware you get the best of me?
I want to know cause you're a mystery
And you're tearing me apart

'Cause I, I need you nah-nah
I feel you nah-nah
I need you nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
I breathe you nah-nah
Can't leave you nah-nah
I need you nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
You walk away right when I'm down and out
Then circle back and say, "I'm ready now"
Just like a roller coaster, round and round
And you're tearing me apart
You watch me burn and then you smile at me
It's like you love to see me on my knees
But you're the only one I'll ever need
And your hands are on my heart

'Cause I, I need you nah-nah
I feel you nah-nah
I need you nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
I breathe you nah-nah
Can't leave you nah-nah
I need you nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah1Embed
