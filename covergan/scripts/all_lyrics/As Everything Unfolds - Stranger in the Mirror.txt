Stranger in the Mirror Lyrics
A fire that's burning, it catches on my soul
Crawling inside like there's no one home
The raging flames around me
Breathe it in, I let it consume me
I told myself I wouldn't become this
Active in the problems I so tried to avoid
An outline of the person that I once was
A shadow moving closer
I just can't seem to find the answer

The stranger in the mirror is smothering me
Grabbing hold of what I want to believe
Pull me out, pull me out or let me drown
Lеt me drown

All my darkest fears arе laid out one by one
A victim of my mind and it's only just begun
It creeps up on you, it drags you down
I won't let it wear this hollow crown
It's not fiction anymore, it's so very real
The black dog, it comes, it hunts, it follows you
We run from our problems like there's no tomorrow
Our reckless minds are so tainted in sorrow
The stranger in the mirror is smothering me
Grabbing hold of what I want to believe
Pull me out, pull me out or let me drown
Let me drown
The stranger in the mirror is smothering me
Grabbing hold of what I want to believe
Pull me out, pull me out or let me drown
Let me drownEmbed
