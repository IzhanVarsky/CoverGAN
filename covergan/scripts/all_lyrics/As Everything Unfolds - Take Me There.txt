Take Me There Lyrics
The sight of heaven is all around us
But the devil, he lives within us
Are we tainted or is it human nature?
It's not sinful living life as strangers
All I know has been taken away from me

Take me there, to the place where you reside
Where apostates become divine
Your holy words are nothing but you still try
Sweet comfort in your close kept lie

Apostates become divine

Blindly led to faith with no choice who we meet at the gates
Only free when we let our minds unleash
Just because you believe He loves you
Gives you right to criticize what path we come through
Take my hand, let's set you free

Take me there, to the place where you reside
Where apostates become divine
Your holy words are nothing but you still try
Sweet comfort in your close kept lie
We have faltered on all your advice
We have called out for you in the night
No sign, no feeling, no hand of healing
Allow yourself to see the light, question and defy
We shall not stand in cages
We won't live words from pages
Question and defy

Take me there, to the place where you reside
Where apostates become divine
Your holy words are nothing but you still try
Sweet comfort in your close kept lie
Take me there, to the place where you reside
Where apostates become divine
Your holy words are nothing but you still try
Sweet comfort in your close kept lieEmbed
