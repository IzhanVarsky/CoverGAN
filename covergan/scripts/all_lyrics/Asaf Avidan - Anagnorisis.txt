Anagnorisis Lyrics
Finally, it's clear
It's always been you
Rain starts to fall
Follow it up
To where it begins
Deep in the ocean

Love is a wave
Love is a wave
Around our bodies
Anagnorisis

Finally, I know
Drenched to the bone
What you call home
I call redemption
Peripeteia
It always ends bad
This time it won't
End

Rain starts to fall
Drowning my body
I swim to you
How long has it been
Dormant inside me
Sleeping away
Love is a wave
Love is a wave
Around our bodies
Love is a wave
Love is a wave
Inside our bodies
