Right Way Lyrics
Been running from your demons lately
Looking for a piece of mind
Searching in the wrong places
Holding onto nothing good

Honey, we don't have to slow down
Tell me what you really want now
I’m sure that I can arrange that

I can love you in the right way
Pick a night, any day
I don't mind babe
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
I can love you in the right way
Pick a night, any day
I don't mind babe
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
I’m there on a daily basis
Don't worry, I'm not out of town
I'd hate to see you go
So I'll make sure I'm the only one

Honey, we don't have to slow down
Tell me what you really want now
I'm sure that I can arrange that

I can love you in the right way
Pick a night, any day
I don’t mind babe
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
I can love you in the right way
Pick a night, any day
I don’t mind babe
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
No matter what you do or say
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right way
No matter what you do or say
Imma love you in the right wayEmbed
