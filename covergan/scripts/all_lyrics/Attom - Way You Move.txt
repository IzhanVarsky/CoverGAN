Way You Move LyricsWanna know the way you move
When it's just you, you in your room
Are you empty now?
Wanna know the way you think
Do you still think, think about me?
Am I in your head?
When you close your eyes
Please dream of mine
Are you, are you empty now?
Are you empty now?
Are you, are you empty now?
Remember how we used to be
We were feeling, falling in deep
We were happy then
What did you forget?
When you close your eyes
Please dream of mine
Are you, are you empty now?
Are you empty now?
Are you, are you empty now?
Are you empty now?Embed
