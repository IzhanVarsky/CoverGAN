On Read Lyrics
Done with the small talk
You throw the same fit
All that I hear is the same thing
You say it's my fault, I never listen
I was just thinkin' the same thing
Playin' the blame game
You've done it again
Fact or fiction, it's all pretend
I'II just leave you on read
'Ti you outta my head

On read, the metaphor spill out
It's all the boy saw when the text message sent out
Saw you at a penthouse, so had to pull my pen out
Knew I had you on a lease now it's time to pull my rent out
The game I done been out, only call me when you need
A lil' more than wanna give each week
Payin' the fee 'cause my time ain't free
I recouped it all, now it's time to leave
Selfish, I know
Had to let go
A couple goodbyes better than a fake hello
A couple long nights, make you feel single
Played the cards wrong, now I'm yellin', "Uno"
I feel like we already know
We been on this road here before (Before, before)
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
'Cause love don't live here anymore, so

Done with the small talk
You throw the same fit
All that I hear is the same thing
You say it's my fault
Never listen
Was just thinkin' the same thing
Playin' the blame game
You've done it again
Fact or fiction, it's all pretend
I'II just leave you on read
'Til you outta my head
Head, head, head, head
'Til you outta my head, right
Head, head, head, head
'Til you outta my head

The more you speak, seem the less I know
Water me with lies then the less I grow
You got somethin' special
But it's hard to see when you act so whack
Never really tried to relate with you
Guess I'II take some blame for that
I don't feel no shame for that
I'II make my bed and lay in that
'Cause everything's sweet, right
Shawty's callin' every week, right, right
Checks comin' from the beats so my number is reserved
Always booked, never free, right, right
I feel like we already know
We been on this road here before (Before, before)
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
'Cause love don't live here anymore, so

Done with the small talk
You throw the same fit
All that hear is the same thing
You say it's my fault
I never listen
I was just thinkin' the same thing
Playin' the blame game
You've done it again
Fact or fiction, it's all pretend
I'II just leave you on read
'Til you outta my head
Head, head, head, head
'Til you outta my head
Head, head, head, right
'Til you outta my head
Head, head, head, head
'Til you outta my head, right
Head, head, head, right
'Til you outta my head

And no need to text back, baby
Just leave it on read
