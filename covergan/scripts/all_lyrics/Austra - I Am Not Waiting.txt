I Am Not Waiting Lyrics
Run away from the trees
With your hands above your head
Run away like you never believed in anything else
Run away from the trees
With your hands above your head
Run away like you never believed in anything at all
Anything at all

When do the seasons change?
When does the ripe fruit fall
Into our laps for taking?
A sweetness I've been craving

I am not waiting for you no more
You've had a warning you just ignored
I am a mountain grown out of work
You dedicated, I'm over you

I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you
Run away from the trees
With your hands above your head
Run away like you never believed in anything else
Run away from the tress
With your hands above your head
Run away like you never believed in anything at all
Anything at all

I am not waiting for you no more
You've had a warning you just ignored
I am a mountain grown out of work
You dedicated, I'm over you

I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you (Over, over)
I'm over you, I'm over you (Over, over)
I'm over you, I'm over you (Over, over)
I'm over you, I'm over you (Over, over)
Over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over

You owe me a romance
We fear we're confessing
Maybe you're just jealous?
I'm so tired of listening to you
(Will you help yourself now
Like love asks you to?)
Run away from the trees
With your hands above your head
Run away like you never believed in anything else
Anything at allEmbed
