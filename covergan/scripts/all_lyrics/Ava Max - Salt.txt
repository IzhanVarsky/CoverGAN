Salt Lyrics
Oh-oh, I got breaking news
And it's not about you, oh-oh
Oh-oh, I've been breaking hearts too
And I learned it all from you, oh-oh

I got my thigh-highs on, feel like Wonder Woman
That's when you want all in, but I'm not your woman
When my lipstick pops and I feel like Monroe
That's when you want me most, oh-oh

I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight
I'm all out of salt, tears are running dry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm all out of salt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm all out of salt
Oh-oh, when I'm 'bout to celebrate
Push my head into the cake, no more
Oh-oh, you're the snake pulling my arm
Like my snakeskin Saint Laurent, oh-oh

I got my thigh-highs on, feel like Wonder Woman
That's when you want all in, but I'm not your woman
When my lipstick pops and I feel like Monroe
That's when you want me most, oh-oh

I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight
I'm all out of salt, tears are running dry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm all out of salt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm all out of salt
Not gonna cry, cry, cry
Not gonna cry, cry, cry
Not gonna cry, cry, cry

I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry (Oh)
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight
I'm all out of salt, tears are running dry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm all out of salt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, I'm all out of salt30Embed
