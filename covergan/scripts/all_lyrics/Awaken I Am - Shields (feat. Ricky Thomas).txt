Shields LyricsI’ve had my turn
Avoiding blind shoulders
Take this indulgence
It’s something I should know
These crowded spaces
New and old faces
Preparing their cages
Like dogs around a bone
It makes the mirror harder to see
Live with the burden
Beneath the defeat
These rules will always be guiding me
Always be finding me
I stand on my own
Quiet I bide my time
Waiting for you all
To drag me from my throne
I gave you my all
All forgotten
Within your reach
A rhetoric sign to be left alone
(In my eyes) I feel I own this right
(In my mind) But I’m not feeling alright
This time
There’s yours and there’s mine
Our place has been divided
(In your eyes) By a subconscious line
(In your mind) That we must now intertwine
This time
I won’t compromise
I won’t be disguised
By a hand in tonight
I’ve taken chances deploring advances
What must I lament for
Somebody to leave me whole?
Take your toll
From patient to anxious
The future is letting you near
And I feel like I’m the only one
Reveling in seclusion
Savoring silence
Waiting for resolutionEmbed
