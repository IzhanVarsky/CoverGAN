Dance Alone LyricsComedian, keep me on my toes
I dance alone
I dance alone
I dance alone
I dance alone
Dressing up in all my father's clothes
I dance alone
I dance alone
I dance alone
I dance alone
I can speak your language if you want
Amnesty and anguish on the phone
Speaking of impermanence I know
I dance alone
I dance alone
I dance alone
I dance alone
We could laugh in shoulders, in cold
No more
Lets dance alone
Lets dance alone
Lets dance alone
Lets dance alone
Keep me at an angle don't forgo
Make me seem untangled and unknown
I don't mind the judgment no
I just mind the tone
I know I'm not the culprit but I'm on my fucking ownEmbed
