Throat Baby (Go Baby) Lyrics
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you

Got a lil' hundred, that's if you want it
Extra lil' forty, gotta come right now
And I got beans you bite down
Super good head, no cap, gown
Since the first time, I been fiendin', couldn't even believe it
Head like that, shit, pussy, don't need it
When she get hungry, she eat my semen
Balls and all, with her mouth, she clean it
Washing machine trick, ooh
Shawty got mean grip, ooh
Know what she came to do
Suck this dick, then she dip, ooh
Head monster, set an appointment
My soul wet, need your anointing
Way too good, may buy you somethin'
Made a whole song, see, I ain't frontin'
I shoot the world for you
I go to war for you
Damn, bae got me trippin'
BOA head, make me cum instant
She ain't even gotta ask for attention (Why?)
'Cause I'ma give it to her (What else?)
Money, I give it to her
Clock on rocks, I give it to her
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you

Sexy lil' redbone, yeah, got a good head on her
Sexy lil' redbone, yeah, I spend a bag on her
With a mouth like that, she can talk her way out goin' to jail
With a mouth like that, if you go to jail, I'll pay your bail
I need you, wanna see you
Suck me up for an hour, I can't help but buy you flowers
When we meet, I get excited
She gon' blow and she gon' ride it
No relations, feeling, fighting
Grip like pliers, I feel it tighten
Girl, I got plans for you, got a couple bands for you
I like the stance on you, good mouth got me like, "Ooh, ah"
Ooh, ah-ah, ooh, ah, ah-ah
Lovin' the, lovin' the mouth
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you10Embed
