FRANCE FREESTYLE Lyrics
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh, yeah, huh, yeah, huh, huh

I took off to France, they go crazy when I land, huh
'Fore I hit the stage, I need the bands in my hands, huh
Bitch, I sleep, sleep with my fingers in my pants, huh
She say she a stripper, she don't fuck, nigga, she dance, huh
Dance, huh, loco for my bitch, don't you touch her, I go frantic
Tall, two by five, big Titanic, I'ma panic

Too many options, love me 'cause I'm gettin' poppin', ayy
Take off the toppings, look in the window, we shoppin', ayy
You be imposters, you playin' outside with the monsters, ayy
I deal with demons, we get on your taco at Neiman's, ayy

Stop takin' my picture
Make your ass delete 'fore I leave, this ain't no concert
Bitch, flight out the country, when I move, I'm in a saucer
Treat her like the burner, once I'm done, I'm gonna toss her
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, beat the box like Bowser
Ho, you's a foe, 'scuse me, I need my hours
Ho, fairy tale, no beef, bitch, you cauliflower
(Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho)
Yeah, tunnel vision, excuse me, you teeny boppers (Yeah, ayy)
Start it, bitch, I double park it (Ayy)
Double, double, double, double, bitch, I double park it (Uh)
Don't talk to me when I stomp in this bitch, ho, ho
Don't talk to me when I stomp in this bitch, ho, ho, yeah
Too many options, love me 'cause I'm gettin' poppin', ayy
Take off the toppings, look in the window, we shoppin', ayy
You be imposters, you playin' outside with the monsters, ayy
I deal with demons, we get on your taco at Neiman's, ayy

When I walk in this bitch, I better get my full stay
This my bitch face, nigga, get the fuck out my way
That's a pump fake, that's what you niggas all say
Say she love me, that's what you bitches all say
Yeah, you lost my trust
You was surfin' on your wave, you lose me for lust
New friends, I'm finna fight, get your mans, ho
Psych, you bow-legged ass bitch, I don't use hands, ho
Yeah, uh, talkin' on my name, I'm gon' do time, ayy
Just got out of school and I'm still paying my fines, ayy
I can't do two hoes no more, just one at a time, ayy
I can't do two hoes no more, just one at a time3Embed
