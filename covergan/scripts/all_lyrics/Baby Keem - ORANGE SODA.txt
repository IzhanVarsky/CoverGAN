ORANGE SODA Lyrics
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy

You know I love it when you talk dirty
Messy, you my orange soda shorty
You act like a lil' me, I wanna fuck you
You the type to kill me, I won't touch you
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
You want me be the man you can vent to?
You let me beat it up, you let me practice
Now I'm finna lay you on the mattress

Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that (Yeah)
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy (Ayy, pull up, ayy)
My lil' baby low-key a flexer
Six figs on the whip, that's a price tag
Lil' best friend bitch tried to press me
I'm that underground nigga with the check, though
I hate a bitch that I can't impress
When you come see the crib, you better die, ho
Young nigga sneakin' in through your side door
Baby Keem, not a wave, I'm a vibe, ho
Seven fig nigga with the big drip on me (Yeah)
Post on your block with your wish list on me

Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy21Embed
