Zombie Lyrics
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme in 2018
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dying
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh


It's the same old theme in 2018
In your head, in your head, they are dying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah36Embed
