As The Music Plays The Band LyricsOn the radio
DJ plays a song
Thank you sir
For the music
Listen night and day
To all the bands that play
Music
Great music
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Back in 1993
I knew what I would be

As the music plays the band
The songs play the music
As the music plays the band
The songs play the music
Wrote this song
For all of you
Out there
With its catchy melody
And simple harmonies
Let the music take control
Let the music take your soul
Everybody sing this song with meEmbed
