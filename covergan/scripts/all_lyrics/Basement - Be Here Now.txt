Be Here Now Lyrics
I sold a smile today
I said it, I said it
Face to face or miles away
I'm in it, I'm in it

I'm trying too hard

I lost myself in the moment
Why can't I just be here now?
Here now, here now
Here now, here now

I'm selling lies again
To make it, to make it
No more surprises when
I end it, I end it

I'm trying too hard

I lost myself in the moment
Why can't I just be here now?
It's looking like I lost myself in the moment
Why can't I just be here now?
Here now, here now
Here now, be here now
When I'm in my head
All the things you said
I'm breaking from the inside out

It's looking like I lost myself in the moment
Why can't I just be here now?
I hate it when I've lost myself in the moment
Why can't I just be here now?
Here now, here now
Here now, here nowEmbed
