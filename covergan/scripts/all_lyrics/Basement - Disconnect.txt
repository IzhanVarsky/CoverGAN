Disconnect Lyrics
Can I go back to where I started?
Have I been away too long to stop this?
Feel like I'm sinking, I
Feel like I'm sinking and there's no way to get out
Can you help me out?

My prodigal son, what have you done?
Return while there's something left
My prodigal son, what have you done
To make you feel this disconnect?

I close my eyes as I keep going
Onto this carousel that won't stop moving
I can see the other side, I
Can't see the other side
And I'm too scared to get up

My prodigal son, what have you done?
Return while there's something left
My prodigal son, what have you done
To make you feel this disconnect?
I've lost all my sense of time
Lost all my sense of time
Please do not forget this is what you wanted
(Lost all my sense of time)
Promise me you'll find a way not to be disconnected
(Lost all my)

My prodigal son, what have you done?
With time while there's something left
My prodigal son, what have you done
To make you feel this disconnect?1Embed
