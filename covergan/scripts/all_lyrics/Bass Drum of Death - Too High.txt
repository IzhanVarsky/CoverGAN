Too High Lyrics
Woke up this morning with a splinter in my head
I'm alright now, I'm alright now
Every time I go down I end up instead
I'm alright now, I'm alright now
Too many times I 
I'm alright now, I'm alright now
Well I turn around, I'm knocked down
They got me feeling dead
I'm alright now, I'm alright now

And if it drives me crazy
I'll do it every time

I'm used to feeling faded
Been here a thousand times
Now there's a letter open
You've got me way too high
Too high, too high
You've got me way too high
Too high, too high
You've got me way too high

Put in a corner with the sharks and the fiends
We're alright now, we're alright now
Look in the mirror while I fumble for the key
We're alright now, we're alright now
Your deed don't cut they're just decoration
We're alright now, we're alright now
You've got champagne eyes when you're handing out lies
I don't mind now, yea alright now
And if it drives me crazy
I'll do it every time

I'm used to feeling faded
Been here a thousand times
Now there's a letter open
You've got me way too high
Too high, too high
You've got me way too high
Too high, too high
You've got me way too high
Oooooh ahhhhhhh

And if it drives me crazy
I'll do it every time

I'm used to feeling faded
Been here a thousand times
Now there's a letter open
You've got me way too high
Too high, too high
You've got me way too high
Too high, too high
You've got me way too highEmbed
