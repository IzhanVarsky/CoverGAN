Prom Queen Lyrics
Shut up, count your calories
I never look good in mom jeans
Wish I was like you
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body

Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your expectations
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen

If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?

Dissect my insecurities
I'm a defect surgical project
It's getting hard to breathe
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks

Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen
If I'm pretty, will you like me?
They say beauty makes boys happy
I've been starving myself, carving
Skin until my bones are showing

Teach me how to be okay
I don't want to downplay my emotions
They say beauty is pain
You'll only be happy
If you look a certain way
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay25Embed
