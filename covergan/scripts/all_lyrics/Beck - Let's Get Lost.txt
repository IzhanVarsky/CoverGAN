Letâ€™s Get Lost Lyrics
Touch me i'm cold, unable to control
Touch me i'm golden and wild as the wind blows
And tumbling tumbling, don't go fascination

If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost

Let me come closer, i'm not your shadow
With our eyes shielding from the oncoming counts
It's not hard for us to say what we should not

If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost

Touch me i'm cold, unable to control
Touch me i'm golden and wild as the wind blows
And tumbling tumbling, don't go fascination

If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
Oooooh ooooooh oooooh
Let's get lostEmbed
