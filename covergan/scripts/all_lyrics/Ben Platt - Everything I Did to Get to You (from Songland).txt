Everything I Did to Get to You (from Songland) Lyrics
I'll admit the fact that I
Settled for somebody
Just to fight the lonely
Put myself out on the line
Tried to change the old me
Changin’ almost broke me

Been the life of the party
Done the worst I could do
Chasin' love that was pointless
‘Til it pointed me to you

All the hearts I ever held
Just held me back
I've been bruised and burned
But somehow I’m intact
All the times I thought I might've
Reached the end
I'd do it all again
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)

On the road to where we are
I think I might've lost me
Somewhere in the city
But you saw me from the start
You see the world that I see
You don't try to fix me
Been the life of the party
Done the worst I could do
Chasin' love that was pointless
‘Til it pointed me to you

All the hearts I ever held
Just held me back
I've been bruised and burned
But somehow I'm intact
All the times I thought I might’ve
Reached the end
I’d do it all again
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
Everything I did to get to you, ooh (Everything, everything)
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
Whoohoo, oooh (Everything, everything)

On the road to where we are
I think I might've lost me
Somewhere in the city

All the hearts I ever held
Just held me back
I’ve been bruised and burned
But somehow I'm intact
All the times I thought I might've
Reached the end
I'd do it all again
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
Everything I did for you
I did for you1Embed
