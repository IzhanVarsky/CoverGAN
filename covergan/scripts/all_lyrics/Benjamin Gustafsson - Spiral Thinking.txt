Spiral Thinking LyricsGo on friend
With your spiral thinking
It’s gonna come around the bend
You must try to find yourself
In this time of waking
Its gonna come around the bend
Anxiety, it’s just making me go low
I try to handle it, its just never stops taking its toll on me
Remember you’re okay
You’re just lost and worried (Just lose and worried)
It’s gonna come around again (Come around again)
But don’t hide, theres no shame (No shame)
Embrace the darkness (Embrace the darkness)
When you sing it goes away (Sing it goes away)
Society, I don’t understand your goals
The majority, they just stress while looking down their phones
I wonder why we feel alone?
Do you remember how I felt?
Did you wonder how it went?
Did you close your eyes? Did you close your eyes?
Cause when I asked you where you went
When all I needed was your hand
I couldn’t find you, but then I found you, you were next to me all the timeEmbed
