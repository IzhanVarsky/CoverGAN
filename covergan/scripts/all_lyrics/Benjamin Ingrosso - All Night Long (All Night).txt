All Night Long (All Night) Lyrics
Well, my friends, the time has come
To raise the roof and have some fun
Throw away the work to be done
Let the music play on
Everybody sing, and everybody dance
Lose yourself in wild romance

We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along, yeah
We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along, yeah

All night long (All night, all night)
All night long (All night, all night)
All night long (All night, all night)
All night long (All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

People dancing all in the street
See the rhythm in their feet, yeah
Life is good, wild and sweet
Let the music play on
Feel it in your heart
And feel it in your soul
Let the music take control
We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along

All night long (All night, all night)
All night long (All night, all night)
All night long (All night, all night)
All night long (All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Everyone's dancing their troubles away
(All nigh-, all night, all nigh-, all night)
Come join our party and see how we play
(All nigh-, all night)
All night long, all night long
Yeah, all night long (All night, all night)
All night long

All night long (All night, all night) (Yeah, yeah)
All night long (All night, all night) (All night)
All night long (All night, all night) (Oh, no)
All night long (All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All night long
All night long
(All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)Embed
