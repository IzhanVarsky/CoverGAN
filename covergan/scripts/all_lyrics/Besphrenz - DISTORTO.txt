DISTORTO Lyrics
I think I'm so high
Can you open up a window, yeah?
Shit, what did I get into, yeah?
Dooh-ooh doo-doo, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got lost with you
Duh-huh duh-duh
Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh

Take another shot I know I shouldn't
Wake up in my jeans and in my hoodie
I don't wanna be the one to say it
But this shit's a little overrated
Packin' up and leavin' in the mornin'
It's a, different night same story
Sayin' things when it ain't important (Woo-ooh-ooh)
When you say it I ignore it, I ignore it

I think I'm so high
Can you open up a window, yeah?
Shit, what did I get into, yeah?
Dooh-ooh doo-doo, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got lost with you
Duh-huh duh-duh
Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Day trippin'
Feelin' like a couple though
Brain insane anyway it's way different
Playin' a game like an addiction
Shit I'm looking for something that ain't listed
A listing
Like ain't showing love if they ain't listed
Ain't even know me if it ain't business
Man they ain't listening
Guess I got it twisted or something

I think I'm so high
Can you open up a window, yeah?
Shit, what did I get into, yeah?
Dooh-ooh doo-doo, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got lost with you
Duh-huh duh-duh
Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh

Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-oohEmbed
