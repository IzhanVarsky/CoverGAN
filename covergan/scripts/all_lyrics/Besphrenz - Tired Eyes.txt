Tired Eyes Lyrics
Wakin' up, I could feel the tired eyes
I can never say enough, about the time it flies
Flies by, it flies by, it flies by, it flies by

Time flyin' (yuh)
I ain't lyin' (no)
Work on livin' (yuh)
You know I'm dyin' (no)
Last year feelin' like last week (last week)
I don't know what time it is, don't ask me (don't ask me)
Hear the bell ring, bitch I'm fuckin' classy (classy)
UberBLACK back to the city in the backseat, yeah, yeah
Boy from the backstreet, ooh
You already know
I cut the line from my bitch
And she tryna hit a mix
Yeah she tryna hit a duo
I'm tryna hit a trio
And one hit the free throw and I'm done with it (yuh)
Tell her roll anotha one cause I'm blunt with it, yuh

Wakin' up, (wakin' up) I could feel the tired eyes (tired eyes)
I can never say enough (say enough), about the time it flies
Flies by (it flies by), it flies by (it flies by), it flies by (it flies by), it flies by (it flies by)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Pour some liquor for Lil Peep and Stein (peep, peep)
Life's a bitch but I still keep in mind (keep, keep)
They talk about all the shit that they talk about too, yeah
That's what they do, yeah
Ain't nothin' new, yeah
Never the red pill, gimme the blue, yeah
Lookin' for somethin' to type but gimme a clue, yeah, okay
Roll up the past and throw away
Whip in the fast lane, go
Lookin' for the past, but no way
Yeah, I know shit is so, so, so lame

Wakin' up, (wakin' up) I could feel the tired eyes (tired eyes)
I can never say enough (say enough), about the time it flies
Flies by (it flies by), it flies by (it flies by), it flies by (it flies by), it flies by (it flies by)2Embed
