Walking on Ice Lyrics
You've got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin, fallin' for you
Got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you

Aye, yeah this one's for you (for you, for you)
You know who I'm talkin' to
We was lit, but now you not you (no, no, no)
Don't just act like you forgot to (you forgot)
Yeah, thought you was the one, I forgot too ()
Oh, you brought your own, I got a lot, too (you know that)
We can go pound for pound, yeah
Pour a couple more and see who stops who

It's a draw, who's gonna pull first?
And you got the people screamin' like the devils in church
It's a draw, who's gonna pull first?
Now we got the people seemin' like the devils in church

You got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
Got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
I'm just tryna get you back, aye (back, yuh)
Drop a pin like where you at (like where you at, yuh)
Drop a pin like this where I stay (me)
Yeah, let me know when you're around my way, yeah (aye, yuh)
I got somethin' that I might say (that I might say)
I just gotta find the right way (the right way)
I just gotta do it my way (my way)
My way (my way), yuh, hey

It's a draw, who's gonna pull first?
And you got the people screamin' like the devils in church
It's a draw, who's gonna pull first?
Now we got the people seemin' like the devils in church

You got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
Got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
You got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
Got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
You got me walkin' on ice
You got me walkin' on ice
You got me walkin' on ice
You got me walkin' on ice
You got meEmbed
