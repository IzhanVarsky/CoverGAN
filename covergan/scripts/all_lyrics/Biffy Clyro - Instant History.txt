Instant History Lyrics
Dear God
Adjust my dreams for me
All I learned is instant history
Is this how
The surface will break?
Releasing the pressure
The horrors that await

Hell hath no fury like a human born
Its only real if you can’t replace it
And now I’m losing all control
Why do I fear it?

This is the sound that we make
Can you hear it?
This is the sound that we make
Can you hear it?
I love the sound when it breaks
Can you hear it?
This is the sound that we make
Can you hear it?

Dear God
We’re shouting in the streets
‘Cause all our love is instant history
We could go
To any time or place
But the history’s a nightmare
I’m sure we’ll awake
I got a fever in my bones
Gets me so high that I can taste it
And now I’m losing all control
Why do I fear it?

This is the sound that we make
Can you hear it?
This is the sound that we make
Can you hear it?
I love the sound when it breaks
Can you hear it?
This is the sound that we make
Can you hear it?

Hell hath no fury like a human born
Its only real if you can’t replace it
And now I’m losing all control
Why do I fear it?

This is the sound that we make
We only exist in the noise that we bring
This is the sound that we make
And we can't unlearn what we've learned
I love the sound when it breaks
We try to position our lives on a string
This is the sound that we make
And we can't unhear what we've heard2Embed
