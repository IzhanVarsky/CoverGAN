Wolves of Winter Lyrics
Record this?!
You are no exception
There are no reruns
Justify your reasons
Now it is my turn
We are the wolves!

How’s it gonna feel when there’s no one to support ya?
How’s it gonna feel when you’re standing there alone?
You are no exception
There are no reruns
Justify your reasons
Now it is my turn

Your fits of paranoia
Drive your every whim
Well have you seen her?
This indelible creature
This is the point we have the choice to be happy together
We have achieved so much more
Than you possibly thought we could
Love that you’re seething
You can achieve anything
Just remember, no "I" in team
There’s two in brilliant
We are the wolves of winter
We live in a kingdom of blood

When you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
When you gonna try to boil my last bone?
This is true obsession
Take me and my worth
Subtle as a steam burn
More than just a scald

You stink of hallelujah
But you wash yourself in sin
Well have you seen her?
This heavenly creature
This is the point we have the choice to survive the winter
We have achieved so much more
Than you possibly thought we could
Love that you’re seething
You can achieve anything
Just remember, no "I" in team
There’s two in brilliant
We are the wolves of winter
We live in a kingdom of blood


We are the wolves of winter
We live in a kingdom of blood7Embed
