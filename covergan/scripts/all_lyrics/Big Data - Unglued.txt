Unglued Lyrics
Yeah
My head is unscrewed
What do I need it for?
My eyes are out of view
Can't see them anymore
Coming unglued, ah
Everything feels so unfamiliar

Must be going out of my mind
Headed for a new space
Leaving it all behind
I gotta make a clean break
I just wanna let you know
That my body is about to blow
Must be going out of my mind
I think I like it this way

Yeah
My tongue and my taste
They don’t know what to say
The look on her face
Can't see it anyway
Coming unglued, ah
Everything feels so unfamiliar
Must be going out of my mind
Headed for a new space
Leaving it all behind
I gotta make a clean break
I just wanna let you know
That my body is about to blow
Must be going out of my mind
I think I like it this way

One, two, three
X, Y, Z
You and me
These are things that go together now
One, two, three
X, Y, Z
You and me
These are things that go together now

Here I come
Going all the way up
Never coming back down
I know what to do
I'll go higher with you
Never coming back
’Cause I'm going out of my mind
Headed for a new space
Leaving it all behind
I gotta make a clean break
I just wanna let you know
That my body is about to blow
Must be going out of my mind
I think I like it this way

Oh-ah (Yeah)
Coming unglued, ah3Embed
