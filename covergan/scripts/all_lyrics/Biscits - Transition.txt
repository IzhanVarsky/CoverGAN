Transition LyricsTake it because you want it
Don't need permission because you already own it
Don't need to fake it, it's time to listen
And get yourself ready to make a new transition
Take it because you want it
Don't need permission because you already own it
Don't need to fake it, it's time to listen
And get yourself ready to make a new transition
You got to—

Take it because you want it
Don't need permission because you already own it
Don't need to fake it, it's time to listen
And get yourself ready to make a new transition
Take it because you want it
Don't need permission because you already own it
Don't need to fake it, it's time to listen
And get yourself ready to make a new transition
Take it because you want it
Don't need permission because you already own it
Don't need to fake it, it's time to listen
And get yourself ready to make a new transition
You got to—
