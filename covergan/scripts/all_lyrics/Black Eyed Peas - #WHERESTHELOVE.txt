#WHERESTHELOVE Lyrics
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on?
Can we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

Yo, what's going on with the world, momma?
(Where's the love)
Yo, people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and attracted to the trauma, mama
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or the meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

Overseas, yeah, they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets, the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind, just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate to the love
So the whole world celebrate it

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on?
Can't we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)
Where's the love when a child gets murdered, or a cop gets knocked down?
Black lives, not now
Everybody matter to me, all races
Y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody, guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart, why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth, then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love, then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Could you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love, where's the love)
Love is the key
(Where's the love)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love)

My mama asked me why I never vote, never vote
Cause policemen want me dead and gone, dead and gone
That election looking like a joke, such a joke, man
And the weed man still sellin' dope, oh no
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope, please hope
All he ever wanted was a smoke, my gosh
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)34Embed
