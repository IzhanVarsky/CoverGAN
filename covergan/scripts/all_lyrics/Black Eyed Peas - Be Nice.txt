Be Nice Lyrics
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice

I just wanna be happy
I don't wanna feel nasty
I'm tryna turn my vibration around so I can feel fantastic
I'm talking to myself in the mirror
I'm telling me to, telling me to cheer up
Everyone around got tears of a clown
And it's so cold like Siberia

But I do not want negative energy
If you get what you give, give me positivity (Give it to me, hey)

Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life

Be nice, be nice
Be nice, be nice
The love you give is the love you get
So be nice and change your life
Be nice
Be nice

I got a new direction
I ain't got no time for stressin'
I don't wanna carry no bad vibration
I don't wanna be in depression
I just wanna be cool, live my life without the problems
Everybody tryna push me down to the ground
But I ain't living life in the bottom

'Cause I do not want negative energy
If you get what you give, give me positivity (Give it to me, hey)

Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life

Be nice, be nice
Be nice, be nice
The love you give is the love you get
So be nice and change your life
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice

If we could all just find a way to fly away
To slip into a brighter day (Say what?)
One step, so deft, so right, go left
And do it to 'em right away
I'm talking to all of my leaders
We should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
And fight for each other, not one another
And when we talk, be nice to each other
Be cordial, be glad, be happy, not sad
Stay in your bag
And all of my banger that bang with they flag
Whether Crip or Blood, be good to each other
Be hood to each other in the house-a, mi casa su casa
On and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on, rollin' on

Hey, be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be nice (Hey)
