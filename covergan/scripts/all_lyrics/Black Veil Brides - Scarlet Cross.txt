Scarlet Cross Lyrics
My mind remains my pain
I'm tied down to this chain
It spirals as I ache
To find holy embrace
Stay with me, I'm afraid of my soul
Blackened and left in control
Cannot be free and you can't deny
The end is coming, the end is coming

Will we live? When we die?
Just keep on saving our goodbyes
The fear and the cost
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross

A symbol for my shame
The color of your name
It's how they see you break
And live with my mistakes
Sin for me, cast away from it all
Watching every letter fall
Hold onto me, and I can't let go
The end is coming, thе end is coming
Will we live? Whеn we die?
Just keep on saving our goodbyes
The fear and the cost
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross

With the fear and the cost
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross

Will we live? When we die?
Just keep on saving our goodbyes
The fear and the cost
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross

With the fear and the cost
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross

With a scarlet cross
With a scarlet cross7Embed
