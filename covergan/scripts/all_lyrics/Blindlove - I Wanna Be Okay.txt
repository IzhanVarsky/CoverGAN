I Wanna Be Okay Lyrics
I'm scared to go out today
I'm anchored in doubt
Been pacing a line from the sink to the couch
See life through a windowpane

And it's never easy to hear your name
And right now I'm needing to make a new change
I know I'll never be the same
Just wanna be okay
I wanna be okay

Have you seen the sun today?
And is the sky still blue?
I'm searching for sounds and for anything new
Just something you can't contain

And it's never easy to hear your name
And right now I'm needing to make a new change
I know I'll never be the same
Just wanna bе okay
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay
I wanna bе okay

And I know that it's never easy to hear your name
And right now I'm needing to make a new change
And I know I'll never be the same
Just wanna be okay
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okayEmbed
