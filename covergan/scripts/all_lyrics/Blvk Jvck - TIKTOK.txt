TIKTOK Lyrics
R-R-Riot at the sauce, boy, Steven
Buddies came with me, now where they dimes at?
All my buddies came with, I got BLVK JVCK

Ey, all my buddies came with me, now where the dimes at?
W-Why you playing? I'm just tryna get behind that
She say she wanna have some fun, it's hard to find now
Allstar, you fucking with allstar
We got 'em sinking, they thinking, they rockstars
They pull up solo but left in a cop car
Drugs got 'em faded, these bitches got locked jaws

She hit the drink and she got loved thе way, she popping lot
You acting shitty, I can't tell if you are up or not
Hеadbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot

She not that famous but she blowing up on Tik Tok
Big bucks
Let's rewind that
Big bucks
Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
She not that famous but she blowing up on Tik Tok
Drip drop, I just blew it on a wrist watch
Like billboard, I been fucking with the big bucks
See you hating, you can meet me at the tip top

She hit the drink and she got loved the way, she popping lot
You acting shitty, I can't tell if you are up or not
Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot

She not that famous but she blowing up on TikTok
Big bucks
Let's rewind that
Big bucks
Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot1Embed
