Desire Lyrics
It wasn't what you wanted
Wasn't like they said it would be
Now I'm being honest
Oh, nothing comes for free
Falling into focus
I was so eager to please
Feeling like it's hopeless
I'm looking for release

I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire


It wasn't what you wanted
Wasn't like they said it would be
Now I'm being honest
Oh, nothing comes for free
Falling into focus
I was so eager to please
Feeling like it's hopeless
I'm looking for release
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire

And if you feel like letting go
You're not alone, you're not alone
And if you feel like letting go
You're not alone

I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I don't want your desire
