AUATC Lyrics
Well, you're up all night
And your head's down low
If you can see your own kite (Shed a little light, oh Lord)
You know a burden ain't a bust
You are the only way to trust ya
No no no
It's only fair it burns up in that rust

Lay down, Martha
Lay down the holy banner flag
Hold out, Martha
Help is surely on its way
And it's not right
Don't bask in the glory of mine
But oh no, they can't come take that part away

They ate up all their cake
And they drank their own wine
They were always on the take (Will you shed a little light, oh Lord)
Well, you know the burden ain't a gust
The only path to love is touch
I'll always know that all that proper mounts too much
Lay down, Martha
Lay all that alabaster down
There's no master and
Help will surely come around
I don't ask
I don't bask in the glory
Oh no (nah nah)
And it's up to me if I don't wear a mask

Well you're up all night
And your neighbors don't know
Man, your neighbors don't know
(So shed a little light, oh Lord)
You know a burden ain't a bust
You know that truth's been known to crutch
No no no
Only them whose pauper lays him up2Embed
