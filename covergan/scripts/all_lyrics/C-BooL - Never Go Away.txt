Never Go Away Lyrics
Hey, if you ever want to leave it all
If you ever want to lose control
Leave it all escape so far away
Maybe then you'll think it is okay
But I'll tell you how I see it now
Take the guitar and I'll tell you how
I just wanna show you how to stay
Listen and you'll never go away (Go away)

Listen and you'll never go away (Go away)

In the glow of starry sky seven nights I would lie
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away

I will never go away
I will never go away-ay-ay
I will never go away
Listen and you'll never go away
In the glow of starry sky seven nights I would lie
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away

I will never go away
I will never go away-ay-ay
I will never go away

I will never go away
Now I know wanna stay
Now I know wanna stay
Now I know wanna stay
I will never go away
Now I know wanna stay
Now I know wanna stay
Stay stay stay stay
I will never go away

In the glow of starry sky seven nights I would lie
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away-ay-ay
I will never go away
Listen and you'll never go away (Go away, go away)2Embed
