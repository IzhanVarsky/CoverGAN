Red Star Lyrics
Ride alone in the rain my love
To see the only star
You hold the wings of a wild-born dove
You thread the needle sky

I'm a red star lately
Through the dark all night
Through the red door faintly
Touch the fear of fire

Tattered throne and a broken crown
To pass the night away
I hold the beams of rider's sun
To make the old time pay
 x3
I'm a red star lately
Through the dark all night
Through the red door faintly
Touch the fear of fireEmbed
