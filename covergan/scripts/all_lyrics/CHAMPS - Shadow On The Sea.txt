Shadow on the Sea Lyrics
I'm sat on the runway
Not a meter of headway
Even the sun is getting sick of the day
I need a replay
Before I can repay
All of my money is for running away
I didn't have to justify my invitation
You know I'm only towing the line
You can be the starlight in my constellation
Lately, it's a matter of time

Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie
Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie

When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea
When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea
I'm chasing a goldmine
I'm buried in lost time
Even the dawn is getting sick of the day
I'm running on water
By the side of the road
Take me to heaven with the money I'm owed
I did a lot to justify my invitation
You know I'm only towing the line
I did a lot to crucify your reputation
Now I feel I'm falling behind

Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie
Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie

When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea
When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea
Talk to me (just can't find your feelings)
Are we river swimming? Saint Marie
(Just can't find your feelings)
Talk to me (just can't find your feelings)
Are we river swimming? Saint Marie
(Just can't find your feelings)

When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea
When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea

Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie
Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie

When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the sea
When you just can't find your feet
When your momma can't take the heat
Brother, know where I'll be
I'm a shadow on the seaEmbed
