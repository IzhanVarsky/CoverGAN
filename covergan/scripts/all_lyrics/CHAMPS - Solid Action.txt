Solid Action Lyrics
All the roses and all your ideas
All your desolation and coloured tears
All your papers are picking up dust again
All the dreams you made at high tide
On the cold ocean of sweat you had
Your five fingers are picking up dust again

So call me buddy
But don’t call me friend
So you can shoot to the top on solid action
I’m picking up stars again
And in the blink of a solid action
I’m falling through the floors again

All your demons and solid ideas
All your intuition, your ill-placed fears
All your papers are picking up dust again
On the beach side, or in your hotel
Are you at the station with your tombstone bell
Are you missing, or picking up dust again

So call me buddy
But don’t call me friend
So you can shoot to the top on solid action
I’m picking up stars again
And in the blink of a solid action
I’m falling through the floors again
And it’s a short, sharp hit
A solid action
I’m fading through light again
Then I can rush to the top of solid action
And it’s killing my heart again

So call me buddy
But don’t call me friend
So you can shoot to the top on solid action
I’m picking up stars again
And in the blink of a solid action
I’m falling through the floors again

And it’s a short, sharp hit
A solid action
I’m fading through light again
Then I can rush to the top of solid action
And it’s killing my heart again
