Deep Lyrics
Behind these eyes, secrets lie
Behind your walls, broken doors
A single rose, a thorn will grow
Tell me your fears, theyâ€™ll stay right here

You're in so deep
You feel my skin
On top of yours
Can we begin?
You're in so deep
You see too much
Loving me is a little rough

I, I want you to love me
I want you to hurt me
I want you to save me
I, I want you to love me
I want you to hurt me
I want you to save me

I want you to lo-
I want you to-
I want you to save me
Dive in
You might never see the bottom
But the mystery is awesome
Don't let me be forgotten
A single rose, a thorn will grow
Tell me your fears, they'll stay right here

You're in so deep
You feel my skin
On top of yours
Can we begin?
You're in so deep
You see too much
Loving me is a little rough

I, I want you to love me
I want you to hurt me
I want you to save me
I, I want you to love me
I want you to hurt me
I want you to save me

I want you to lo-
I want you to-
(I want you to love me)
I want you to sa-
I want you to-
I want you to-
I want you to-
I want you to save me2Embed
