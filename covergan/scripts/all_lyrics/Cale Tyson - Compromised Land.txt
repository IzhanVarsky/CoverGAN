Compromised Land LyricsLet's turn off the world turn it off again
Re-set all the madness we've started to let in
Is it fear disguised as power? Could it take the upper hand?
No it can't, no it can't
It's as if we exist in some compromised land
Where the rich don't supply and the poor drown 
It's one-side escape, either way leads 
We must stand, we must stand
The devil is in disguise and he's dealing out the dangers
To the girl, removing her heart with a coat-hanger
It's the only thing to do when they take the right to choose
Take my hand, take my hand
We must stand, we must stand
You can color me the flag, paint me red white and sad
Hang me up for the  say it isn't true
You can laugh or you can cry but never can't comply
Make a stand, make a stand
And he fills people with fear of the people who aren't from here
As he screams at the top of his thumbs and he fires this thoughts like a gun
How the hell can you  for a TV star to 
Give 'em a hand, give 'em a hand
Take a stand, take a stand
I'll confess that I've spent years writing songs for cheers
About love that might have gone wrong or a sad country song
But there's something on my mind and it's cruel to act so blind
We must stand, we must stand
We must stand, we must stand
Take my hand, take my hand
Give a hand, give a handEmbed
