Not Healthy Anymore LyricsPick up your feet when you walk away
Don't be a drag and say
"Might be a chance"
Don’t tiptoe around in my fragile mind
You know all I've got is time
Too, too much time
Fate, it knocks upon my door
Maybe it's not healthy anymore
In the morning I fight my way out of bed
Wrestle my foolish head
Never can win
But I make it
Down to that hip cafe
Where people all dress the same
And sit all alone
They never remember my order here
Swear I could just disappear
It’d all be the same
And I wonder if that'd be the case for you
So you could find someone new
And I'll be old
Crying on the kitchen floor
Maybe it's not healthy anymore
There's twenty mosquitos in my house
And you're sittin' on my couch
Guess that makes twenty-one
And I'm sorry but sometimes you seem like one
Your love, I cannot outrun
As much as I try
And I sit here while you’re at the therapist
She’ll convince you you're over this
And prob’ly be right
But after you'll check on my Instagram
Reach out for the upper hand
And prove that you're fine
We don't have to start a war
It’s just not healthy anymoreEmbed
