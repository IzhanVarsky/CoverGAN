I Created Disco Lyrics
Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating disco

Well it was the mid 70's
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And I, I was conducting various sonic experiments
With the assistance of Mary, my wife

Anyway during one session I discovered that
By using a succession of techniques
I, I actually developed during the war
I could create an entirely new genre of music
And that was the night I created disco

I created disco

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating
Disco, disco, disco, disco, discoEmbed
