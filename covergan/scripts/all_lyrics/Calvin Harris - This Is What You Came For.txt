This Is What You Came For Lyrics
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

We go fast with the game we play (Game we play, game we play)
Who knows why it's gotta be this way (Be this way, be this way)
We say nothin' more than we need (Than we need, than we need)
I say, "Your place" when we leave

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Yeah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh74Embed
