Future Days Lyrics

All you're gonna do for all that you do
Is all you're gonna do all
And when I'm coming home tonight
Do you think you can do, the people away to do it all?
I'm coming home and away you go
To the all and all you go

I just think that room's to end, how commend them from your dreams?
Save that money for a rainy day for the sake of future days
You better have nothing for me, you better move year on your face
You have to help apologise for the sake of future days

You're spreading that lie, you know that
You're getting down, breaking your neck
When doing that was breaking home
What have you done, free the night?
Within that breaking home
Was breaking that break up home
Was rolling up, break the wall
And the tall wind did break your home, roll, roll on
I just think that room's to end, how commend them from your dreams?
Save that money for a rainy day for the sake of future days
You better have nothing for me, you better move year on your face
You have to help apologise for the sake of future days

And the night you're losing, light down from your dreams
Save that money for a rainy day for the sake of future days
You better have nothing for me, you better move year on your face
You have to help apologise for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, said it's all for the sake of future days

I just think that room's to end, how commend them from your dreams?
Save that money for a rainy day for the sake of future days
You better have nothing for me, you better move year on your face
You have to help apologise for the sake of future days

For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days1Embed
