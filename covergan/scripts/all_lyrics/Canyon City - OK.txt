OK Lyrics
I used to think I would die
Here alone and I was fine
Leaving nothing much behind
A few guitars, a couple lines
A broken heart, white lies
A white light opened my eyes

When you’d float through the door
I couldn’t close them anymore

Hey, I’m not ok, but I’m better than I was
Say, it’s been some day, laying out here when the sun
Stays long, till it’s late and the colors we become
Hang, lingering and fade
In some time it comes back up
Give it time, it comes back up

I used to want a little more
No matter what I had before
Never enough and never sure
It couldn’t be what I couldn’t have
No moments ever coming back
But I don’t need those empty hands

Now they’re filled to the brim
When your love slipped in

Hey, I’m not ok, but I’m better than I was
Say, it’s been some day, laying out here when the sun
Stays long, till it’s late and the colors we become
Hang, lingering and fade
In some time it comes back up
Give it time, it comes back up

If you ever feel like nothing here is yours
There’s so many days but none they made you for
I can promise you there’s sunrises in store
Though the nights are long, there’s peace you’re walking towards and

Hey, I’m not ok, but I’m better than I was
Say, it’s been some day, and we’re finally in the sun
Stay, long till it’s late and the colors we become
Hang, lingering and fade, in some time it comes back up
It's so bright now that you've come
And you’re finally in the sun
I used to think I would die here alone, oh what a lieEmbed
