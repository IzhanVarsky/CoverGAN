Home Lyrics
Home, home
Home, home

She just does what she pleases
'Cause she's happy on her own
And she picks up all the pieces

She's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

Home, home
Home, home
Home, home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Baby, I'm home

It all seemed so easy
Home, home
'Til she did it on her own
Home, home
There's so much she can teach me
She's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

She's better off than she has ever been
Home, home
Now she's made her peace with everything
Home, home

Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
She's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm homeEmbed
