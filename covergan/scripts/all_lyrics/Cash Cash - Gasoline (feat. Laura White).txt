Gasoline Lyrics
Crash into me like a car
Hit me with adrenaline
I know that we shouldn't start
Turning up the heat again
Oh, no

Don't open the windows
Don't let any air in
Don't need innuendos
Wearing what your wearing
Ain't no way to say no
Caught up in the tension
You got my attention

There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
And when we get so close, it's hard to breathe
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (Gasoline, gasoline)
With gasoline
With gasoline
There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
Why do I come when you call?
We don't even get along, oh, nah
Chemically our chemicals are dangerously beautiful
Oh, right

Don't open the windows
Don't let any air in
Don't need innuendos
Wearing what your wearing
Ain't no way to say no
Caught up in the tension
You got my attention

There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
And when we get so close, it's hard to breathe
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (Gasoline, gasoline)
With gasoline
Fire with gasoline

Crash into me like a car
Hit me with adrenaline, yeah
I know that we shouldn't start
Turning up the heat again, oh, nah
Fire
It's hard to breathe
Fire (yeah)
There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (It's hard to breathe)
And when we got so close, it's hard to breathe
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (Gasoline, gasoline)
With gasoline
With, with gasoline
With gasolineEmbed
