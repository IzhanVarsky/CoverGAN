I Found You Lyrics
On the way I was crowned a king
Felt the wind underneath my wings
I've been high and I've been low
Played the fool and the star of the show
Gone along for a wild ride
And I can say lookin' in your eyes
That it all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way

I found cynicism, I found criticism
I've been the zero, the hero
And I have been the villain
I lost more than a heart can take
But I found you on the way

I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way


On the way I was given the keys
To the city they were mine to keep
Over time every lock'll change
But you love me all the same
I found pessimism, I found skepticism
I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions
I lost more than a heart can take
But I found you on the way

I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way

I found you on the way
I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
It all would have been a waste
But I found you on the wayEmbed
