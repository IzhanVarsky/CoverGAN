Big ol' booty gotta jump, gotta juke me
Gotta plan, got a duty
Gotta dance, gotta boogie
I'm a fan, gotta stan
Gotta cam, it's a movie
Make my 'Gram look like Cannes, like in France
Mamma, mamma, mamma mia
Tell me what your momma feeds ya
You getting that cornbread and choreo
Let me throw you on the story though
Trying to beat it like story mode
You belong at the war zone on
Wala, Wala
Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala
Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala

Nigga, you can't dance
My feet like my hands (eeh)
Your feet like quicksand (yeah)
Something I can't stand (yeah)
Something I just hate (eeh)
I'm not on no date (yeah)
Car don't got no roof (yeah)
Works, don't got no brake (eeh)
Girl don't got no waist (yeah)
Watch don't got no face (eeh)
Jet don't got no plates
God don't got no cape (uh)
Shoes don't got no J's
Don't got no style, don't got no taste (eeh, eeh)
Bank don't got no card, don't got quickpay, don't got no Chase (yeah)

Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
You know I gotta Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam

Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Watching DBZ
Shorty stuck to me
Like she lowkey USB
I just want some head, want some lowkey guillotine
Police watching me like I'm lowkey new TV
Like I'm serving twenty p's
Like I lowkey used to be
Over the seas with my girl cause she over achieve
And don't put nobody over her king
Love my life
Shorty ride my face like bike
I'ma beat it like Mike, not Ike
Might split bro shit
On life, I might spent all you made
All year, all night
I might fuck some bands up
Or fuck your mans up
I might fuck some bands up
Or switch the plan up
Leave the country like right now
Shit, I might cop flight
I might take off tonight
I might, on life, I might
Tonight I might
Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala
Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala

You need a name tag
She got the same ass
Same drawers, same car
Same bag, damn fraud
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, shake it up
Pop-pop-pop that cork
Pop it like July 4th
Shorty's don't move like yours
She got it from a store
You got it from the Stork
They don't do this up North
They always been indoors

Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
