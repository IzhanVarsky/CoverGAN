Room at the Table LyricsHow many times
Have you heard them say:
“The future is uncertain
And everything must change”
But all of my worries
And all of my fears
Begin to lose their weight
When I hold you near
If all that we are
Is what we believe
Then I know I gotta be
The change I wanna see
How easy we forget
That everything takes time
No, nothing's ever perfect
But I still call you mine
Through all the years
Every lesson learned
When each word can’t be a blessing
To listen is to love
Can we afford to be kinder
To others and ourselves?
There’s always room at the table
And water from the well
And I know
A house doesn’t make a home
But you’re never really lost
When you’re never alone
And I know
A house doesn’t make a home
May the stories that bind us
Give new strength for us to hope
I’ll be living for the day
Where our differences make us whole
How many times
Have you heard them say:
“The future is uncertain
And everything must change”Embed
