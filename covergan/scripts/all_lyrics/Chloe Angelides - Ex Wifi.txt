Ex WiFi Lyrics
Said you needed affection
But you got no reception
So many philosophies
Open my door, you lost your keys

I don't wanna be your ex
Late last night I was 'bout to send a text
Then the WiFi went
Oh that's a sign
Oh that's a sign

Why you making me feel like I'm wrong
Couldn't handle all the off and on
Takes a lot for me to feel alone
And you did it on your very own

I don't wanna be your ex
Late last night I was 'bout to send a text
Then the WiFi went
Oh that's a sign
Oh
Sometimes I wanna hold you
Sometimes I just
Sometimes I wanna hold you
Sometimes I just

This ain't fair but this is war
I saw through clouds but now I don't
This ain't fair but this is war
I saw through clouds but now I don't
Yeah, I still miss our connection
I thought I learned my lesson
Always had me second guessing
If you were fucking with my best friend

I don't wanna be your ex
Late last night I was 'bout to send a text
Then the WiFi went
Oh that's a sign
Oh that's a sign

Sometimes I wanna hold you
Sometimes I just
Sometimes I wanna hold you
Sometimes I just
This ain't fair but this is war
I saw through clouds but now I don't
This ain't fair but this is war
I saw through clouds but now I don't

This ain't fair but this is war
I saw through clouds but now I don't
This ain't fair but this is war
I saw through clouds but now I don't

I don't wanna be your ex
Late last night I was 'bout to send a text
Then the WiFi went
Oh that's a sign
Oh that's a signEmbed
