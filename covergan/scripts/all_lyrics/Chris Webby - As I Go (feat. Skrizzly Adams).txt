As I Go Lyrics
I'll pray tomorrow but I'm sinning today
I'm full of nothing with a grin on my face
I beg for something that I'll never taste
But I'm still gon' chase
Take it all as I go

I guess it's just the human condition
Whether losing or winning
We just keep on chasing something until it's skewing our vision
Being happy is obtainable, but it's also unsustainable
We all got a hunger that isn't tameable
The empty concept of success
Shit, we can't even define it, but still we fiending for it, never the less
Feel like we need it to achieve it, shit we tend to forget
What really matters, the laughter, I should be hedging my bets
But I've been all in
Down in these trenches I'm here running
Chasing after the rush of it, trying to feel something
Noise all around, ain't no quiet, I hear buzzing
And numb out the sounds that been in my ears, drumming
The inner voice struggles from a loss of sight
And causes fright until the fucking jaws of life
Got me tossing in my bed with my thoughts at night
I channel 'em and work through it when I'm on the mic
Y'all want that raw shit right?
Well this as raw as it gets
Through it all, I keep my chin up, acknowledge I'm blessed
But as I'm caught in the stress, feeling lost in the mess
And hollow at best, that's when I'm going off to reflect
And see it all like
I'll pray tomorrow but I'm sinning today
I'm full of nothing with a grin on my face
I beg for something that I'll never taste
But I'm still gon' chase
Take it all as I go

Life been weighing heavy and I'm feeling it
When I get wounded, I never get to healing it
Never stop moving, so I don't gotta deal with it
Hard to be a homie when they see you like a meal ticket
I just really need a spaceship like that old Kanye shit
Or make a makeshift airplane and take trips
Away from it all so my brain escapes it
Change, erase this pain my frame's encased with
Y'all see me as the person that I choose you to view
Just like you, and shit I got my insecurities too
Y'all see me like the superhero shit, I wish it was true
But it's the fans that keep me going, yo, I'm living through you
Because the fame is an illusion, the money ain't a solution
It's proven, but still we addicted to the dilution
No absolution, what I've learned in conclusion
It's hard to be a motherfucking human

I'll pray tomorrow but I'm sinning today
I'm full of nothing with a grin on my face
I beg for something that I'll never taste
But I'm still gon' chase
Take it all as I go
I'll pray tomorrow
I'm full of nothing
I beg for something
Take it all as I goEmbed
