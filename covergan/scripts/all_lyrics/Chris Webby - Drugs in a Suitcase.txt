Drugs in a Suitcase Lyrics
I got that paraphernalia, riding off in the desert
Psychedelics on me, I don't even know where I'm headed
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase

Yeah, I got a Ayahuasca shaman, Hunter S. Thompson
And Dr. Gonzo in the whip, my bih'
Drugs in the trunk, you need 'em, I got 'em
Weed to the speed, believe I got options
You don't got yours? It's cool, I got mine
Pockets always full of sunshine
I got medicine from Mescaline, Excedrin
Shit I got everything that you could even imagine
Mushroom eatin' in cabins, way out
Deep in the mountains, no one's
Even around us, gettin' high
Gettin' high-igh-igh, yeah
Shit

I got that paraphernalia, riding off in the desert
Psychedelics on me, I don't even know where I'm headed
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase
I got those micro-doses, macro-doses, I'm on a wave
I got them mushroom caps and acid with Peyote for days
I got the drugs in the luggage at the Super 8, yeah

Yo, got my third eye wide open
Acid, high-dosing
With Psilocybin inside of my potions
High by the beach, up in the sky, floatin'
Clouds in my reach, seeing birds-eye, coastin'
Woah, Webby Airlines takin' off
Put your seat in the upright position, we gone
When the drugs hit hit, recline and get launched
To infinity and beyond

I got that paraphernalia, riding off in the desert
Psychedelics on me, I don't even know where I'm headed
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase

I got that boost up in my aura and I'm feelin' myself
Strung, holdin' in a dirty motel
Got them psychedelic drugs leadin' my way
Ooh, I got them psychedelic drugs leadin' my way
I got that paraphernalia, riding off in the desert
Psychedelics on me, I don't even know where I'm headed
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase
I got the drugs
I got the drugs in a suitcase2Embed
