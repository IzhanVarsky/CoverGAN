Our Way Lyrics
They say I'm a non-believer
All I know is what I’ve seen
I've seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
We might be bruised but we’re not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way
And I say...

Hey, make it our way
Make it our way, 'til the river runs dry
We 'gon make it our way
Make it our way
Make it our way

I'm just trying to find the silver in the lining, just trying to keep on surviving
And trying to keep my composure as everything is declining
Lines drawn in the sand and everybody is divided
But living under pressure is bound to produce a diamond
We been rising with the heat so, we grow
Flipping on that beast mode
Mind over matter is the metaphoric cheat code
And everywhere that we go, we walk around as equals
Amigos, who recognise we all one people
'Cause we 'gon make our way through it eventually, mentally
Change fundamentally, swap ego out for empathy
Third eye blind, open sesame
Presently, fulfilling destiny and becoming who I was meant to be
They say I'm a non-believer
All I know is what I’ve seen
I’ve seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
We might be bruised but we’re not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way
And I say...

Hey, make it our way
Make it our way, 'til the river runs dry
We 'gon make it our way
Make it our way
Make it our way
And I say...
Hey, make it our way
Make it our way, ’til the river runs dry
We 'gon make it our way
Make it our way
Make it our way

Ever since somebody drew the lines that divided us into nations
Designed to give rights to the trials and tribulations
Difference in pigmentation, religious affiliation
Political party biases really were all the same beneath the surface
And nobody is perfect, regardless of who you love
Or regardless of who you worship
We all got survivor in us, we all got that fire in us
We all got one shot at life, and I'm willing to die to live it
So bring in the violinist, and bring in the choir too
We all gotta' find within us the thing that inspires you
The thing that'll wake you up, the thing that's inside you
Now think of that thing, and use it to drive you
Gotta' use it to pick you up, whenever you feeling low
Just bottle that feeling up, and do not let that feeling go
And always know that, as we travel down this long dark hallway
All I know is that we gonna' make it our way
They say I'm a non-believer
All I know is what I've seen
I've seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
We might be bruised but we're not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way
'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way
And I say...

Hey, make it our way
Make it our way, 'til the river runs dry
We 'gon make it our way
Make it our way
Make it our way
And I say...
Hey, make it our way
Make it our way, 'til the river runs dry
We 'gon make it our way
Make it our way
Make it our wayEmbed
