Tropicana Lyrics
I got the Tropicana
Pomegranate with banana
The king of every jungle ask Rafiki my savanna
Covers everything the light'll touch
Here to Indiana to Atlanta
To Louisiana, all the way to Cana-da
Breaking through all the parame-ters
Puttin' on a show, you better get your came-ras
Stamin-a, like Kung Fu Panda, bruh
Ani-mal, don't let me get my hands on ya
Reakin' havoc like Donkey and Diddy all through ya city
Until I make an illegal turn and the officers get me
I'm off of the wall like a flat screen robbery, really
I give the people what they wanted, you feel me?
I got the juice

Remember
I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
I got the juice, nananana
The Tropicana, nananana
Remember
I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
I got the juice, nananana
The Tropicana, woah
I got the juice like I'm squeezin' on fruits, I'm leadin' the troop
I'm stayin' steezy and loose at ease in the booth
Drop the kind of shit you press and play and keep it on loop
From simple to complexity that you can't even compute
I'm speakin' the truth, as it's always been since I was juvenile
Truly wild, step up in that building King Louie style
Make your cutie smile with the shit I say
What can I say? I'm that dude, always been that way
Yeah, I've been the greatest, highly imitated when I drop
Still I stay on top, shit, I never miss when takin' shots
They ain't messing with the mango or the lemonade I got
So much juice that my refrigerator stopped, they can't stop the pace
I'm one dude you cannot replace
This ain't artificial flavor in our concentrates
I got the grapes, I got the squeeze you can't touch
Get yourselves a cup, bottoms up
Yeah

Remember
I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
I got the juice, nananana
The Tropicana, nananana
Remember
I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
I got the juice, nananana
The Tropicana, woah
Nananananananana
Nananananananana
I got the juice, that Tropicana
Nananananananana
Nananananananana
I got the juice, that Tropicana

Remember
I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
I got the juice, nananana
The Tropicana, nananana
Remember
I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
I got the juice, nananana
The Tropicana, woah1Embed
