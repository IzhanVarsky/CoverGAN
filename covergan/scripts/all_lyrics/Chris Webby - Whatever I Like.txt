Whatever I Like Lyrics
Webby back up in this bitch, running at the fucking lip
Proud to be American? Huh, yo fuck the government
The president ain't doing shit
And everybody knows, a fucking country is controlled by corporations, CEO's
Tell me how they locking people up for 20 bags of 'dro
The people making laws the biggest criminals on the globe
Feeling is different now that I'm old enough to see right through the media
And search to find the truth through all the bullshit that they feeding us
Kids today are learning what they know from Wikipedia
And take whatever pills the fucking doctor says you need in ya
Generation RX, now I'm fucking dependent
On attention medications cause I've been on em since I was seven
Now we need Adderall to wake up, an Ambien to sleep
Vicodin to ease the pain and steroids if you're feeling weak
And everybody on the street is on their phones like they don't give a damn
And kids are learning social skills from Facebook and Instagram
So I light up a doobie and exhale, blowing smoke up in the sky
While I'm looking at chemtrails
With grimy politicians and twisted Mayan predictions
I'm like fuck it, let me just enjoy my time while I'm living
The shit is got me saying

I don’t give a fuck if you don’t like me
You’ll never find another motherfucker like me
Somebody stepping to the kid is unlikely, so bite me
I do whatever I like (I do whatever I like)
With these words that I write (with these words that I write)
Soon as I pick up a mic (soon as I pick up a mic)
I do whatever I like (I do whatever I like)
Bitch I do whatever I like
I'm so fly my attitude will take you to a cruising altitude
Of a view that will show you how a falcon moves
I got no rules I'm not prohibited or limited
Excuse me if I'm offending you, suck my dick my people is feelin' it
Feminine feelings about my opinions just let me know that I'll be scarier
Free style equal free speech; I thought this was America
America, home of the free, land of the brave
I'm at home on the stage, I fuck your head up
Like trying to run a comb through the braids
A dog in the rap game and still ain't got no bone thrown in my cage
A fucking immature juvenile, only thing wrong is my age
And you won’t sit you’ll see sick like the boat rocking on waves
And honestly I gotta be a paranoid
Cause I watch my iPhone but I feel like my iPhone is watching me
I'm in a whirl-wind, I wonder where the world went
Cause that motherfucker can help you find me faster than my girl can
And this world is fucking up, this world is fucking us
Technology fucked us up, and Siri you're a fucking slut
The way this world turning is beyond me
Between the economy, astrology, and bath salt zombies, I'm like

I don’t give a fuck if you don’t like me
You’ll never find another motherfucker like me
Somebody stepping to the kid is unlikely, so bite me
I do whatever I like (I do whatever I like)
With these words that I write (with these words that I write)
Soon as I pick up a mic (soon as I pick up a mic)
I do whatever I like (I do whatever I like)
Bitch I do whatever I likeEmbed
