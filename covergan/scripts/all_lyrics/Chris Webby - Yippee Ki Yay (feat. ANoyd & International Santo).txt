Yippee Ki Yay Lyrics
Tell 'em what it's gon' be, new school OG
Puttin' weed smoke in the breeze
Ya'll 720p? We EightyHD, fully high def' emcees
And you know we goin' right on in
Dark side, call me Kylo Ren
Ice cold flow, cryogen'
Fuck an IOU, I leave an I owe N-O one
I'm self made in the Lion's den
I got a big roar, big suite on the sixth floor
Big money, big score, big big tour
I'm such an animal, I'm showing up when Noah's Arc ship boards
Shit, I'm big ill, where the sick ward?
Pull the rip chord, paratrooper
Lyrical semi-automatic and I'm letting off shells like I'm jumping on a Koopa
Stone cold like I'm looking at Medusa
Click-clack, bang when I aim the bazooka
Comin' for your fuckin' neck like you're rockin' a chain in the water with Barracudas
Better reconsider where you scuba
Killin' it well from livin' through Hell while fillin' the L
Knowin' that one day I'd be livin' this well
Webby dope, ya'll just really gotta listen to tell
The boy fresh like I still got silica gel up in the pocket
Trippin' like aquatic
Mammals on land, god damn, yo, I got this
Stack my deposits, hot shit, cookin' with the phonics
2020 vision better watch it, ow
I been on a wave and I did it my way
And we gon' get it all day
If you get in my way then I'm diggin' your grave
Yellin' out, "Yippee Ki Yay"
I been on a wave and I did it my way
And we gon' get it all day
If you get in my way then I'm diggin' your grave
Yellin' out, "Yippee Ki Yay"

I'ma die hard, drive off, better give me five stars
Even with the paid time off, I'ma grind hard
Lights on, lights off, shootin' on a tripod
I frost, ice ice, vanilla ice ya'll
"Yippee Ki Yay", don't forget it, um
You can tell the difference, Eminem and Xzibit
I don't give a fuck about a critic, um
'Cause part of being human is making stupid decisions
I'm living proof that the kid is more Brucer than Willis
Tequila juice in syringe injected into our livers
Give little fucks like midgets stickin’ up middle fingers
And when I drop shittin', you on the stool like a pigeon
That's how you makin' a name by
I'm rubbin' off on my pupils like pinkeye
I should say, "Welcome to the home of zero fucks
I'm glad you came by"
And I wave bye, and became high
I'm on a plane, no, I'ma hang, no, I'ma hang-glide
I go insane, look at the brain, look at the play by
I go to Spain, take it in vein, I go to Shanghai
And became a black belt at the same time
Need I say more, it should never had to be that way
Say what's on your chest and what you feel, man, dígame
Be honest, I can hear you from a hundred feet away
I'ma live Yippee Yippee Ki Yay either way
2020 vision and I'm still living irate
You livin' Yippee Ki Yay or you live bait
Drinkin' to the last drop as lightweight
It's Yippee Ki Yay (Yippee Yippee Ki Yay)
I been on a wave and I did it my way
And we gon' get it all day
If you get in my way then I'm diggin' your grave
Yellin' out, "Yippee Ki Yay"
I been on a wave and I did it my way
And we gon' get it all day
If you get in my way then I'm diggin' your grave
Yellin' out, "Yippee Ki Yay"

Motherfucker, we goin' right on in
