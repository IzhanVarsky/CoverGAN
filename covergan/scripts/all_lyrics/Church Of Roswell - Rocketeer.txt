Rocketeer LyricsGood morning moon
I'm feeling indestructible
Just rolling through
This city like a wrecking ball (Ooh)
Good morning stars
Where did all my wishes go
I've been looking for
Heaven through my telescope (Ooh)
Nothing's gonna bring me down
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
'Cause I'm so high
I'm gonna fly
Up like a rocketeer
10 million light years away
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
Good morning love
We always were dysfunctional
You had to leave
Just when we got comfortable (Ooh)

Good morning god
I hoped that I might find you here
And bring you back
To earth just like a souvenir (Ooh)
Nothing's gonna bring me down
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
'Cause I'm so high
I'm gonna fly
Up like a rocketeer
Out through the atmospher–µ
CHORUS
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
Nothing's gonna bring me down (Ooh)Embed
