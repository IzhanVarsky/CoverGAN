Going up the Coast Lyrics
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up, sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling

I was driving in a van, I was older than
I, and I plus five, heading Kanye West
Off the tip of Argentina
Better than drowning in gin
Ain't got no saint to blame instead
Of my reflection, so I dreamt
I packed it all like Anderson
To end up where it all began

I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up, sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Used to want to live in Brooklyn
With a view from my apartment
No more homies on the block, like
On the corner like a stoplight, yeah
On the coast they never lose it
Never showed up for the showbiz
To get back to the beginning
When I knew why I was singing

I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up, sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling

Brown sugah, she called me
The last time we spoke
This hard rive, gone save me
She answered, I know

I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up, sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up, sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling1Embed
