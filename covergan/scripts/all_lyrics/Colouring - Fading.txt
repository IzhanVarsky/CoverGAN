Fading Lyrics
Call it just a drill
Darling, don't leave this way
Broke this world we built
With only ourselves to blame
Cried all of your makeup on my shirt
I don't know how to let go
It was you always
Is it just too much to fix
To keep alive the flame?

Is all of your love
Fading, fading out?
Don't give up
Baby, baby now
Is all of your love
Fading, fading out?
Don't give up
Baby, baby now

All the stupid things we said
Just two kids we are
I smell of booze and cigarettes
And we're shouting in your car
Say it's not over yet
I was built by your heart alone
Where do I go from here now?
How do I find a place to call home?
Is all of your love
Fading, fading out?
Don't give up
Baby, baby now
Am I ever gonna see your face again?
Just say that this is not thе end
And I'll find you down another road
We'll light up thе world together again
I'll be waiting, waiting now
Oh-ooh

Is all of your love
Fading, fading out?
Don't give up
Baby, baby now
Is all of your love
Fading, fading out?
I'll never give up
Baby, baby nowEmbed
