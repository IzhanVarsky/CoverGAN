Oh My God! LyricsOh lord, can you hear me now?
Oh god, are you giving me grace?
Your blood so watered down
But how you flow through my veins
And every word that I'm trying to get out
"No, it's not enough," you say
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
Oh lord, can you hear me now
You know I believe in you
What game do you wanna play
Now I've nothing left to lose?
I said I'd give you everything
I'll stick but you want the moon
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
Oh my god, this love, I can't kick it
Oh my god, I'm worshiping now
Gripping on so tight till I kill it
Gripping on, where's heaven we found?
It's holy hell, now she believe in it
What else can I do but pray now?
She's the judge and jury, executioner
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
Oh love, see me holding on
It's you that I'm trying to serve
We're running round in circles here
And we never seem to learn
If I let you go now
Let the soul out
Will you still spin my world around?
And be the judge and jury, executioner
Oh my god, this love, I can't kick it
Oh my god, I'm worshiping now
Gripping on so tight till I kill it
Gripping on, where's heaven we found?
It's holy hell now she believe in it
What else can I do but pray now?
Oh my god, this love, I can't kick it
Oh my god, I'm broken in two
Gripping on so tight till I kill it
Gripping on to something in you
It's holy hell now she don't believe in it
But what else can I really do?
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
And I'll say it again
And I'll say it again again again
Will there come a time
When we can turn the bends?
We can turn bends
If I could meet you half way home
Does that make the drug? Does make you the cure?
Oh my god, this love, I can't kick it
Oh my god, I'm worshiping now
Gripping on so tight till I kill it
Gripping on, where's heaven we found?
It's holy hell, now she believe in it
What else can I do but pray now?
She's the judge and jury, executioner
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
I'm worshipping now
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
Where's heaven we found?
(Wooo)
(Wooo)
What can I do?
What can I do?Embed
