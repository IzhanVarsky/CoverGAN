Wake Lyrics
When you've arisen
The sun is rising over there
Feel like I'm trying
Wanting to give into the wind
And I want to sail on, yeah
I'm not going back to yesterday

And I wanna wake
I wanna change
It don't mean a thing
If it don't make you feel
Like you can be amazed
I'm now waking up
Ready to learn from my mistakes

You told me to try it
Too busy fighting off the fears
I gave up the lying
Trapped in a circuit you could break
And you want to sail on, yeah
There's no going back to yesterday

And I wanna wake
I wanna change
It don't mean a thing
If it don't make you feel
Like you can be amazed
I'm now waking up ready to learn
Waking up ready to learn
I wanna wake
I wanna change
And it don't mean a thing
If it don't make you feel
Like you can be amazed
I'm now waking up
Ready to learn from my mistakesEmbed
