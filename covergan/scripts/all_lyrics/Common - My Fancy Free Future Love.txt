My Fancy Free Future Love Lyrics
Yeah, uh

L-l-l-l-l-let's go on
We we-weather-weather the storm
Love comes through and we get it on
Been through the PM just to see the dawn
They say it never rains in Californ'
That done changed 'cause of global warming
Depends on what you use for a lens
I was told God used rain to cleanse
In you I got a friend, your kin is my kin
I prayed for a woman, so I say amen
A gift in my life that can't be boxed in
You don't complain when I watch SportsCenter Top 10
Over and over again, no more holding it in
Let's write a love story, we don't know where it end
I'm beginning to understand and understand women
Yeah, understand forgiving, understand commitment
Understand living in love with no division
Understand she gon' be like, "Nigga, just listen"
Girl, in me, a King has risen
So close, the future don't seem as distant

So fancy free, 'cause I wanna be
To understand part of me
So fancy free, 'cause I wanna be
To understand part of me
Ah, ah, new shoes, ah, ah, new clothes
Really that glow is from your inner soul
You a good DJ as long as you ain't blow
Red carpet looks I tell you when they coals
Use no stylist, you know I joke childish
My Gambino is black not Italian
Let's watch ATL, drink wine, and order Postmates
Background music either Anita or Ghostface
Any time I get with you, it's a dope date
You juicin'? Don't lose too much weight
Mind full of Gotti, Soulcycle for the body
Your hero's Angela Davis, mine's is Ali
I probably couldn't have done this, years ago
Relationship journey is spiritual, lyrical
Written in the sky above, it's a higher love
If it get ashy, we can start applying love
We can work, we can laugh, we can cry in love
Let's get gray, then we can die in love
Tell the first responders, this is a fire love
Gratitude, to the Most High above

So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me
So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me
You my partner, da-na-na-na-na-na
You are part of, da-na-na-na-na-na
This is sparks of, no matter what they call it
This is God's love, our love
You get spicy, any time I act like a Pisces
That's the only time you really wanna fight me
Can't copy sex, still you can bite me
That could be the start of our black clan like Spike Lee
You help me with my lines, tell me when my raps are wack
When I'm sick you got remedies to battle back
Your jellyfish theory we could master that
I love you this lifetime and after that

So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me
So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me

Ooh– yeah
