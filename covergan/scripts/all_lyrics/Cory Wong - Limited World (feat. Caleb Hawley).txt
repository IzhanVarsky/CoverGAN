Limited World Lyrics
Straight up to the gate
I  don't want to be late
Uber  man
I've got a plane to catch
Time to make an escape
Ain't  it gonna be great
When  they read my name...
Yeah!
Time  to show this little town
What they've been missing
Shoulda' never ever listened
To the rhythm of the prison
They  were never gonna
Have it my way

Get up, take a seat
Listen up, turn around to the beat
Chin up, take a seat
Oh it's not what you think
Get up, take a seat
Listen up, turn around to the beat
Chin up, take a seat
Oh it's not what you think
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
And they ain't seen nothin'
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
And they ain't seen nothin'
Take your time and learn
A little about what you came from
Ooh thought you were gonna
Change the world so fast
Ooh thought you were gonna
Put your name on blast
(Cory Wong!)
Ooh when you gonna learn
That fame don't last
(Scooby dooby doo)
And you're gonna burn out
If you go too fast

Took a trip to Minneapolis
Found a little bar
Somewhere in that northern loop
Picked up my guitar
When I lay it down
Gonna show my attitude
But it felt a little different
They were playin' different rhythms
And they called it 'old school'
Yeah... they went a little harder
Than I was used to

Get up, take a seat
Listen up, turn around to the beat
Chin up, take a seat
Oh it's not what you think
Get up, take a seat
Listen up, turn around to the beat
Chin up, take a seat
Oh it's not what you think
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
And they ain't seen nothin'
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
And they ain't seen nothin'
Take your time and learn
A little about what you came from
Ooh thought you were gonna
Shock 'em all so fast
Ooh now you're dropping' names
Tryin' to make it last
(Yeah man, check it out. I was hanging out with Cory Wong the other day)
Ooh said you never would
Run out of gas
(Scooby dooby doo)
(Yeah, we're pretty tight now)
But you're gonna burn out
If you go too fast

They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
And they ain't seen nothin' yet
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
Whatchu give ain't what you get
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited world
They be livin' in a limited worldEmbed
