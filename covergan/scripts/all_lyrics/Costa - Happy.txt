Happy in the Morning LyricsWith kisses sweet you wake me
With the first tease of the sun
And I'm gonna have my day made
Before it's even begun
If it's between working or playing with you
You helpin me make up my mind
'Cause it don't matter if I miss the train
They don't pay me enough anyway
And if they did I'd forfeit every dime to hear you say
I'm about to make the sun shine brighter in your day baby
You make me happy in the morning
And when I go to bed
You take all my naughty thoughts
And they get put to use instead
And it feels like I've been dreaming
But my pillow never hit my head
You make me happy in the morning
Your sugar's too sweet to ignore
Maybe just five minutes more
Your love is shining all over my world
Better run if you don't plan on making something of yourself
But I give in the minute you give me
Some loving on which to dwell
I'll take on the world tomorrow 'cause
I'm taking off today
'Cause it don't matter when you take me on
Before the sun even rises
All my troubles stay far away
'Cause you're a sight for sleepy eyes
And it's a wonder I get anything done
With your kind of love in my life
You make me wanna get up on the morningEmbed
