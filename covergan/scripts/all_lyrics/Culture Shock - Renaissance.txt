Renaissance Lyrics
Taking me deeper
Getting me higher
Making me stronger
Stronger when I’m with you

All that you inspire
My burning fire for you
Taking me deeper

Deeper
Taking me deeper
Taking me deeper
Getting me higher
Making me stronger
Stronger when I’m with you

All that you inspire
My burning fire for you
Is it forever
My burning fire for you

I was still dreaming
All of these feelings
I can hear you breathing
Let me breathe with you
Taking me deeper
Deeper

Taking me deeper
Deeper
Taking me deeper
Getting me higher
Making me stronger
Taking me deeperEmbed
