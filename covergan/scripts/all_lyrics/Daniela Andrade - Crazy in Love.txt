Crazy in love LyricsI look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
It's a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no on else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now your touch's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin so crazy your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh
When I talk to my friends so quietly "Who he think he is?" look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Cause I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now your touch's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin so crazy your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh
Got me looking so crazy, my baby I'm not myself lately I'm foolish, I don't do this I've been playing myself
But baby I don't care
Cause baby your love got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Baby you got me
You got me going crazy
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh ohEmbed
