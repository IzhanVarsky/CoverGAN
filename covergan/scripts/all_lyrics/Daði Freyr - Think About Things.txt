Think About Things Lyrics
Baby, I can't wait to know
Believe me, I'll always be there, so

Though I know I love you
I find it hard to see how you feel about me
'Cause I don't understand you
Oh, you are yet to learn how to speak
When we first met, I will never forget
'Cause even though I didn't know you yet
We were bound together, then and forever
And I could never let you go

Baby, I can't wait to know
What do you think about things?
Believe me, I will always be there, so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen


When we are together
There isn't anywhere that I would rather be
Three birds of a feather
I just hope you enjoy our company
It's been some time and though hard to define
As if the stars have started to align
We are bound together, now and forever
And I will never let you go
Baby, I can't wait to know
What do you think about things?
Believe me, I will always be there, so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen

I might even know what to say
But either way
At least I'll be
There!

Baby, I can't wait to know
What do you think about things?
Believe me, I will always be there, so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen20Embed
