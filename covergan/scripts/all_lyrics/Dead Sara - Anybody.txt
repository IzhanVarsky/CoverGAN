Anybody LyricsCall out, call out, I was hoping you'd find me
Head up, head up, 'cause I want you so proud
I'm lost, you're lost, but you know we're not lonely
Walk it off, walk it off, and don't you slow down
And I heard it from the rooftop
From the mountains that you were coming in, ah
And I heard it from your best friend
From the silence when I asked how you've been, ah
Come on and touch me
Do I belong to anybody?
Want me
'Cause all I know is do or die
For the love
For the love
Come on and touch me
Do I belong to anybody?
So loud, so loud, I just wanna hear you scream it
Move your mouth, move your mouth, I just want it out loud
And I heard it from the voices in the rain clouds
That you were coming in, ah
And I heard it from your cousin in the doorway
When I asked how you've been, ah
Come on and touch me
Do I belong to anybody?
Want me
'Cause all I know is do or die
For the love
For the love
Come on and touch me
Do I belong to anybody?
Are you gonna let me down?
Are you gonna let me down?
No you won't let me down
No you can't let me down
Come on and touch me
Do I belong to anybody?
Want me
'Cause all I know is do or die
For the love
For the love
Come on and touch me
Do I belong to anybody?
Anybody, anybody
Do I belong? Do I belong? Do I belong?
Anybody, anybody
Do I belong? Do I belong? Do I belong?
Anybody, anybody
Do I belong? Do I belong? Do I belong?
Anybody, anybody
Do I belong? Do I belong? Do I belong?Embed
