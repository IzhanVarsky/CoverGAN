Hands Up LyricsWhen you piece it all together
They're just fragments of imagination
Leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
With your hands up, hands up, woo
Hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up
Pulling the tulips up by the roots
Shaking off the dirt to get a look at you
Throwing the heartache onto the flame
Landing just where my body lay
And I don't believe that look in your eye
Give me a reason to even try
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
Yeah, so you can say that you've had enough
Well, I've had еnough
As you leave mid-conversation, so frustratеd
With your hands up, hands up
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
Yeah, well, I am
The power to choose and the right to refuse
You said it doesn't matter, but it bothers you
Full-blown panic, you were howling at the moon
It's hard to forget what you never knew
I don't believe that look in your eye
Saying nothing said it
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
Yeah, so you can say that you've had enough
Well, I've had enough
As you leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
With your hands up, hands up
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
And I feel frustration
But I couldn't talk out loud
Clear desperation
I'm blacking out
When you piece it all together
They're just fragments of imagination
Leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
With your hands up
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
Yeah, so you can say that you've had enough
Well, I've had enough
As you leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
With your hands up, hands up
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
Oh yeahEmbed
