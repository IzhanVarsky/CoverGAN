Heavenâ€™s Got A Back Door LyricsI'm through feeling sorry
For the things that I can't choose
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
Heaven's got a back door too
Out of walls I heard the voices of the preacher
Telling me all the reasons why I'd die alone
I've never been your perfect song, your favorite daughter
So I sit and dwell on all the things I know are wrong
I don't wait, I don't wait for it
To be gone
I'm through feeling sorry
For the things that I can't choose
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
When will I stop running
From the things I know are true
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
Heaven's got a back door too
I've never been on the same sidewalk as a steeple
May we take notice in regard to the unknown
I don't know whether to the press me farther or the people
I've never been a perfect soul, oh
I don't wait, I don't wait for it
To be gone
I'm through feeling sorry
For the things that I can't choose
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
When will I stop running
From the things I know are true
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
It's not your time to go and waste it
And it's all about your timing
But I'll wake up to leaves on the ceiling
Been wondering why you said
I'm through feeling sorry
For the things that I can't choose
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
When will I stop running
From the things I know are true
If I made it this far being who I am
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
A back door too
Heaven's got a back door through
And I'm running through
And I'm running through
Heaven's got a back door throughEmbed
