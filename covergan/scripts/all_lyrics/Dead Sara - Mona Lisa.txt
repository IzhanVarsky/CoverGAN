Mona Lisa LyricsMmm
Mmm
Come on, baby, show me your favorite
I'm as addicted as the lips to your cigarette
I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me
To adore you
All right
All in favor, take a stand and defend me
I'm so cold and lonely, I could be dead
But I'm doing all right
Mmm
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
Cleaning my hands are my bloody fingers
My brain is scattered like the thoughts in my patter (Ha!)
'Cause I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me, c'mon
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
Throw some salt over your shoulder, baby!
I got a new low
Forward put me back
I got a new low
It's all right, put me back
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo
(Oh, I really hate, I really hate us)
I said
I said
Ha
While I was thinking of it
Well, I just thought I'd mention
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
And it's not gonna be, not gonna be
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
