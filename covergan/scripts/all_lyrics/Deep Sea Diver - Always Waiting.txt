Always Waiting LyricsI keep filling up the room
With white noise and thoughts that abuse
Ooh, I was a shield, I was so cruel
I am a shield deflecting you
And I'm always waiting for the right words to explain it
But the time won't ever come if you wait
And I wait
As I crawl and I drag my heels in the wilderness
I hear your voice, you know I'm running on fumes
I was a shield, I was so cruel
Now you're the one I can't get through
Cause I'm always waiting for the right words to explain it
But the time won't ever come if you're
Always waiting for the right words to explain it
But the time won't ever come if you wait
Always waiting for the right words to explain it
But the time won't ever come if you wait
And I waitEmbed
