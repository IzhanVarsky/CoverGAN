Impossible Weight LyricsThis is what it feels like walking in a straight line
Stray talk clicking in my ear
This is what it feels like
Cliff dive broken mind
Wondering how I got here
A million times tongue tied
Spit it out
Never mind
I think I’m addicted to the fear
Stutter in my heart
From the hurry up
Stop dragging my heels around
Dragging my heels around
But that was then and this is now
I tried so hard not to let you all down
It’s an impossible weight
So I’ll just let you down now

Steady as the wheel turns
On my way it’s ok
Picking up the pieces
Put ‘em down
Stutter in my heart
From the hurry up
Stop dragging my heels around
Dragging my heels around
Dragging my heels around
But that was then and this is now
I tried so hard not to let you all down
But that was then and this is now
I tried so hard not to let you all down
It’s an impossible weight
So I’ll just let you down now
It’s an impossible weight
It’s an impossible weight
But that was then and this is now
I tried so hard not to let you all down
It’s an impossible weight
So I’ll just let you down nowEmbed
