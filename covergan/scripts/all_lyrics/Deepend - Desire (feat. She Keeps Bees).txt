Desire LyricsI will follow the sound of the owl
Bless this house, bless my pillow
Bless your pillow
Desire, where you want to be?
Lovingly
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece
Sandpaper and gum, leaning and propped
Our arch undone, our arch undone
Desire, where you want to be?
Lovingly
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece
Desire, where you want to be? 
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece
Sandpaper and gum, leaning and propped
Our arch undone, our arch undone
Desire, where you want to be? 
Desire
Desire, where you want to be?
Lovingly
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece
Desire, my long way
The wrong way
