Ohms Lyrics
We're surrounded by debris of the past
And it's too late to cause a change in the tides
So we slip into our hopeless sea of regret as I stare

Through the haunted maze in your eyes
Right through where I'll remain for all time

And time won't change this
This promise we made
Yeah, the time won't change this
It's how it'll stay

This is our time, we devour the days ahead
We've been possessed by these changing times
As we slip on through, we promised to meet again somewhere

Through the haunted maze in our minds
Right through where we shall remain for all time

Yeah, time won't change this
This promise we made
And time won't change this
We shall remain6Embed
