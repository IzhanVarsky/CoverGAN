Every Breath You Take (Re:Imagined) LyricsEvery breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you
O can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please
I keep crying baby, baby, baby, baby pleeaase
Baby please
Oh oh oh oh I'm watching you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm watching you,,
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
With every breathe you take,,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Every move you make
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll be watching you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll be watching you
O can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you2Embed
