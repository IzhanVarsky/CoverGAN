Us vs. Them (The City Will End Tonight) LyricsBring me
Bring me to life
Give me hope
I am whole again
Don't speak
It's not the time
Take me now
I'm a memory
And it grows cold
It grows cold
It's us against the world
Running
Run out of time
Every slope
Sinking under
It's almost gone
Gone
The city will end tonight
It's us against the world
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down, won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down)
It's us against the world
The city will end tonight
Somehow we'll survive
We'll make it out alive
It's us against the world
The city will end
The city will end
The city will end
The city will end tonight
