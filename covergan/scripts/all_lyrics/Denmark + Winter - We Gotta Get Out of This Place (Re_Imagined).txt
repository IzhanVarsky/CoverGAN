We gotta get out of this place (re:imagined) LyricsIn this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refuse to shine
People tell me, "there ain't no use in trying"
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due......
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
'Cause there's a better life
For me and you
For me and you
Watch my daddy in bed and tired
Watch his hair been turning gray
He's been working and slaving his life away
He's been working so hard
Iv'e been working so hard
I've been working so hard
Wanna get away
Wanna get away, get away
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
Cause there's a better life
For me and you
For me and you
In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refuse to shine
You'll be dead before your time is due
We gotta get out of this place
We gotta get out of this place
We gotta get out of this place
If its the last thing we do
If it's the last thing we do
If it's the last thing we do
If it's the last thing we doEmbed
