Settle Lyrics
Here in the silence, no sound
Out of the madness, we're alone now
Caught in a motion, 'round and 'round
In the eye of the storm, I forget what it means to feel down

Oh

I'm warm in sweet surrender
You are all I know
And your arms are shelter
With your love, I will settle
Oh

Oh

Here in the silence, no sound
Out of the madness, we're alone now
Caught in a motion, 'round and 'round
In the eye of the storm, I forget what it means to feel down

I'm warm in sweet surrender
You are all I know
And your arms are shelter
With your love, I will settle
And your arms are shelter
With your love, I will settle
You arms are shelter
Oh
I will settle
Your love
And your arms are shelter
With your love, I will settle
And your arms are shelter
With your love, I will settle
YeahEmbed
