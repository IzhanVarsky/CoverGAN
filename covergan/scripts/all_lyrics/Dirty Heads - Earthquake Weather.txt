Earthquake Weather Lyrics
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue

We can go anywhere in the world, darling. You just say the word
I'd love to go to an island. That would be marvelous
I hear New California's nice this time of year
Well, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen

Yeah, this is earthquake weather
Left a couple chicks with a scarlet letter
Toss all the money in the paper shredder
Never felt better, never been meta
World peace, climb trees, I'm deep
Can't get drunk if there ain't no drink
And you can't kick sand if there ain't no beach
Earthquake weather, down for whatever
Little bit of pain and a little bit of pleasure
Try to get me got, get a little bit of never
Can't talk high, too stoned, Rosetta
Technique, I'm deep, no sleep
Can't get drunk if there ain't no drink
And you can't kick sand if there ain't no beach
Kick sand if there ain't no beach, no
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue

Well this is earthquake weather
What's that even mean man? Ahh fuck it, whatever
Yeah, we all in this together
I'm a getting going now, never feelin' better
Call it Sword Beach, yeah, vacation forever
But you can't get high if there ain't no weed
And you can't kick sand if there ain't no beach
Earthquake weather man, down for the elements
Southside overcast, breezy with the warm glow
Inside chilling out, smoking in my bathrobe
Can't go to work if you ain't got a job
You ain't got shit then you can't get robbed
Can't kick sand if you're standing knee deep
And you can't kick sand if there ain't no beach
Kick sand if there ain't no beach

West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
And the earth spoke
And the sky sang
What a wonderous choir
It was a great separation
And the people of the land rejoiced as they drifted off into the sea

West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blueEmbed
