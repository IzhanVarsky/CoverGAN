Vacation Lyrics
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then you should go and change it
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay

Everybody sour like a lemon tree
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
Do this shit, I love it on the daily
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave
But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
My brother called me up said he saw me on TV
I said, "it wasn't easy, but right now I'm living breezy."
Build this engine from the ground up, now my hands they ain't so greasy, feel me?

A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay
Illuminate my future bright
So thankful for everything
Rejuvenate my inner light
As I work hard for all I need
Open arms, embracing life
And all of which you gave me
Hard work, it pays off
I'm happy now, it's paying me
Close my eyes sometimes it feels as if I go away
I love the life I live and enjoy the ride along the way
"I make a living out of living," yeah, that's what I say
I've got one life to live, and I wouldn't live it no other way

A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay

Van Gogh my earlobe
I can't hear, I'm here though
I may be a weirdo, but this is my year, yo
My life may be crazy
My lack of the lazy has let me do shit that I love on the daily
Daily, daily
Get to do this shit I love upon the daily
Daily, daily
Everybody go and live your daydreams up
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then you should go and change it
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay6Embed
