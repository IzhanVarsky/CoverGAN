In The Blood Lyrics
I walk on water now
And I can't even swim
I might surrender now
But I'm not giving in
Still hear you laughing loud
Laugh inside my head
Love is a monster
Underneath my bed
Oh, laugh inside my head

(Oh no, what a ricochet)
But it's in the blood, oh yeah
(Oh no, what a ricochet)
Well it's in the blood, yeah

I'm on to something good
Seems too hard to find
Taking me somewhere
Far beyond the lines
Oh, seems so hard to find

(Oh no, what a ricochet)
But it's in the blood, oh yeah
(Oh no, what a ricochet)
Well it's in the blood
Not a ricochet
You oughta know by now
It's in the veins somehow
If it feels like something comes from nothing now
It's in the blood

(Oh no, what a ricochet)
Oh, it's in the blood, yeah!
(Oh no, what a ricochet)
Well it's in the blood
No, not a ricochet
You oughta know by now
It's in the veins somehow
If it feels like something comes from nothing now
But it's in the bloodEmbed
