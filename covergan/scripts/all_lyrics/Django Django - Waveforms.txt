Waveforms Lyrics
Waveforms reach through my mind
And take me back there tonight
The reverb I feel, it signals to me
It's never been far from sight
A long time ago, my heart was in two
It's written in black and white
The rhythm machine through the smoke and the screen
Their heads in the hills tonight

Oh, you wanna know why
All these rivers run dry?
And when I see you again
I see it there in your eyes

Radar scanning my mind
Lost in the clouds above
The rattle of drums, the click of my thumb
Their eyes in the hills below

Oh, you wanna know why
All these rivers run dry?
And when I see you again
I see it there in your eyes
Oh, you wanna know why
All these rivers run dry?
And when I see you again
I see it there in your eyes
Waveforms
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Take it apart and break it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Take it apart and break it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Take it apart and break it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Take it apart and break it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Take it apart and break it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Take it apart and break it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Couldn't recreate it, yeah3Embed
