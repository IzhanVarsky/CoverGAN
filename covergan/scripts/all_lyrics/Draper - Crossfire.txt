Crossfire Lyrics
I confess, I’m drawn to the wreckage
Fool me once, I’ll be back for the second
Got my dress on my flesh is my weapons
Give me Armageddon
I will be waiting for you in the crossfire, crossfire
I know it looks like war, but it feels like love

‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
‘Cause it feels like love, but it feels like-
I will be waiting in the crossfire

Follow the signs saying no way hit the breaks
But we accelerate, ‘cause it feels like love
We see the water and it’s riptide, tidal wave
But we wade anyway, ‘cause it feels like love

Seeing red, black and blue, and I wonder
Am I wrong to be feeding this hunger?
You and I bring it out in each other
Give me technicolor
‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
‘Cause it feels like love, but it feels like-
I will be waiting in the crossfire

Follow the signs saying no way hit the breaks
But we accelerate, ‘cause it feels like love
We see the water and it’s riptide, tidal wave
But we wade anyway, ‘cause it feels like love
(Feels like, feels like love)
(Feels like, feels like love)
(Feels like, feels like love)
(Feel like, ‘cause it feels like love)
(Feels like love)

And when my senses tell me I should run
I will hold my ground ‘cause you’re the only one

‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
‘Cause it feels like love, but it feels like-
I will be waiting in the crossfire
Follow the signs saying no way hit the breaks
But we accelerate, ‘cause it feels like love
We see the water and it’s riptide, tidal wave
But we wade anyway, ‘cause it feels like love
(Feels like, feels like love)
(Feels like, feels like love)
(Feels like, feels like love)
(Feels like, ‘cause it feels like love)Embed
