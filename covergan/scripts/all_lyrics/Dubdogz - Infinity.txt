Infinity Lyrics
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity

Don't know when it started
And I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure
That I'm gonna get the bends
And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity
If you wanna

Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity


Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you, oh, you, oh, you, oh, you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity

Don't know when it started
And I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure
That I'm gonna get the bends
And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity
If you wanna

Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity (If you wanna)
Oh, you know we are the infinityEmbed
