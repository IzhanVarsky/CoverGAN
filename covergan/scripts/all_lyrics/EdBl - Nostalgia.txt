Nostalgia LyricsWhen did you stop running through my mind
How did I miss the change from easy all the time
To something harder where I take all the blame
I hadn’t noticed till you said you did the same
It’s true the first year was too good
False sense of hope for the future
Never thought I’d feel indifferent
If you pulled the curtains the end
Back then I thought we could make it
Think now its mind power wasted
Are we too comfortable to ask for more
Wе’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
Convеrsations always turn into fights
Kinda worried that theres no route for us
I’m tired of tryna get it right
Been keeping quiet but it feels like torture
Saying nothing but you see it in my eyes
If we say it out loud is it over?
I’m tired of tryna get it right
Sometimes I wish you would just make me hurt
So I’d be forced to suck it up and adjust
I’m being lazy can’t be bothered to fight
So I continue hoping you can read my mind
It’s true this doesn’t feel right
But I’m too scared to pick our last fight
Never thought I would be this cautious
I guess I’m worried that it’s me who’s caused this
If so, I’ll put the work in
But it seems wrong to feel like I’m working
Are we too comfortable to ask for more
We’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
Conversations always turn into fights
Kinda worried that theres no route for us
I’m tired of tryna get it right
Been keeping quiet but it feels like torture
Saying nothing but you see it in my eyes
If we say it out loud is it over?
I’m tired of tryna get it right
Tired of tryna get it
I’m so tired of tryna get it right X4
I keep trusting nostalgia
Keep hoping thats what we still are
But I think we changed back there, not sure how far

Can’t lean on our sweet nostalgia
Can’t focus on what we were before
I think we might need more
We’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
Conversations always turn into fights
Kinda worried that theres no route for us
I’m tired of tryna get it right
Been keeping quiet but it feels like torture
Saying nothing but you see it in my eyes
If we say it out loud is it over?
I’m tired of tryna get it rightEmbed
