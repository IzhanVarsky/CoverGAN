Table for Two Lyrics
He takes me out somewhere nice
And he wears that shirt that he knows I like
My baby is always on time
'cause he knows how to get it right
He can place my order 'cause he knows just what I wanted
It feels like he's reading my mind
Any time of day I can call him just to say
That I wanna have him by my side

You know I can't get enough of your love
You know I can't get enough of your love
You know I can't get enough of your love
I don't want anybody else but you
Just us at a table for two

I don't want anybody else but you
Just us, a table for two
I don't want anybody else it's true
Just us at a table for two
I don't want anybody else but you
Just us, a table for two
I don't want anybody else it's true
Just us at a table for two
He loves me in subtle ways
And there's not one thing that I would change
My baby never, ever complains
And he learns from his mistakes
I don't see him all the time
But it doesn't matter 'cause he's always on my mind
He tells me how he feels and doesn't lie
Everything is in black and white

You know I can't get enough of your love
You know I can't get enough of your love

I don't want anybody else but you
Just us, a table for two
I don't want anybody else it's true
Just us at a table for two
I don't want anybody else but you
Just us, a table for two
I don't want anybody else it's true
Just us at a table for two1Embed
