The Way Things Were Lyrics
(Bad guy in a movie
Bad guy in a movie
Bad guy in a movie, movie)

I was impatient
I was unsure
Spent too much time trying to seem mature
I took it for granted
I know I took my time
But I've come around and want you to be mine

It's all a little better now
But I still regret
Might be better now
But baby, don't forget

The way things were
Do you remember how they used to be?
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
I was the bad guy in a movie
The way things were
Do you remember how they used to be?
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
I was the bad guy in a movie (bad guy in a movie)
It must have been hard
To keep your cool
When you were hanging out with such a fool
I don't know why you stayed
You must have felt so played
Like we were back in school

It's all a little better now
But I still regret
Might be better now (oh, oh, ah)
But baby, don't forget

The way things were
Do you remember how they used to be?
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
I was the bad guy in a movie
The way things were
Do you remember how they used to be?
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
I was the bad guy in a movie (bad guy in a movie)

(I was the bad guy in a movie
I was the bad guy in a movie
I was the bad guy in a movie
I was the bad guy in a movie
I was the bad guy in a movie
I was the bad guy in a movie
I was the bad guy in a movie)
It's all a little better now
But I still regret
Might be better now
But baby, don't forget
But baby, don't forget

The way things were
Do you remember how they used to be?
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
I was the bad guy in a movie (bad guy in a movie)
The way things were
Do you remember how they used to be?
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
I was the bad guy in a movie (bad guy in a movie)1Embed
