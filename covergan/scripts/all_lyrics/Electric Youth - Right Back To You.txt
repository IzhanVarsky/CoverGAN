Right Back to You Lyrics
I turn the light on
And see your pretty face
I turn the light off
Wishing that I could free space
I turn away
And know you're never far away from me
So I stay for another day

If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day
I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say
I'm coming right back to you

I learn to run off
So I can keep the pace
And never a moment goes by
I wouldn't trade for your embrace
Skies of gray
I know you're never far away from me
And I stay for another day
If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day
I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say
I'm coming right back to you

Won't you stay with me
Won't you stay with me


If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day
I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say
I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day
I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way
I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say
I'm coming right back to you1Embed
