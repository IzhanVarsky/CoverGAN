Without You Lyrics
Here I am alone again, I did my best
Gave it all and now I don't know what is left
All these moments, all my movements
I thought they were mine but now
I’m where I am alone again without you

And I've spoken to my friends
But they just don't know who I am
I tried to fix it but I don’t know where to start
And as time keeps slipping by
The feeling's eating me alive
Only to stop before it pulls me all apart

So who am I without you?
And who's gonna find me when I'm lost?
I fall back into the same old pattern in my heart
'Cause I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
Yeah, I'd rather break in two than in a million parts

Caught up in these feelings, I know I'm to blame
Trying to rewind ’cause nothing stays the same
And all these people telling me that I should let it go
But I’m just who I am, alone again without you
And I've spoken to my friends
But they just don’t know who I am
I tried to fix it but I don't know where to start
And as time keeps slipping by
The feeling's eating me alive
Only to stop before it pulls me all apart

So who am I without you?
And who's gonna find me when I’m lost?
I fall back into the same old pattern in my heart
'Cause I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
Yeah, I'd rather break in two than in a million parts

Calling you up, but you're keep falling back
And you should probably look for something new
And I know that I'm flakey and I'm all kinds of crazy
But I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do?

So who am I without you?
And who's gonna find me when I'm lost?
I fall back into the same old pattern in my heart
'Cause I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
Yeah, I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
So who am I without you?
And who's gonna find me when I'm lost?
I fall back into the same old pattern in my heart
'Cause I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
Yeah, I'd rather break in two than in a million partsEmbed
