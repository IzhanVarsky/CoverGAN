Power Lyrics
You got to get a hold of yourself

Now you're playing with power
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me

Don't talk to me, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
It's the ways of the underground

Don't talk to me

These things do happen

Now you're playing with power
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
It's the ways of the underground

Don't talk to me
Check the technique

Haven't you had enough?Embed
