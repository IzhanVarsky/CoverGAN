Room Lyrics
Left my clothes all over the floor
I can barely walk to my bathroom door
Way too high to clean up
Hard to find anywhere to be
Everywhere I go I’m up to my knees
Lost my mind in my stuff

I’m going off the rails
My mind just broke the scale

I’m in my room about to lose it
I’m way to tall for my bed
I’m out of room in my room
I’m out of room in my head

Been inside over twenty days
February’s gone I threw it away
Half my life I’m sleepin’
So tired of doing nothing
Way too tired to do anything about it

I’m going off the rails
My mind just broke the scale
I’m in my room about to lose it
I’m way to tall for my bed
I’m out of room in my room
I’m out of room in my headEmbed
