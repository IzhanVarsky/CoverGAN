WIYULD LyricsWell I’m hot
But I stay stone cold
Like a deep freeze
And the heat makes the ice melt
Turn me to an ice cream
Lil Mop and I stay clean
Break the ice for my dime piece
Head to toe in my nice things
Hold the door for her nicely
She likes me in my Nikes
Hi-C got her loose
Let me tell you we got the juice
I’m a Greek so she calls me Zeus
She likes green
We in the produce
Aisle
Line it up in that single file
Run it up like I’m running miles
And I feel
WIYULD WIYULD WHY
AND I FEEL
WIYULD WIYULD WHY WHY
And I got people in my DMs
AM to the PM
Asking who I’m seeing
Got a man or can I be him?
Hispanics, Europeans
Talking to Norwegians
Swear I must be fluent in the lines that I am speaking
I party every weekend (weekend)
Champagne in the deep end (deep end)
Even on a Sunday we still party while he’s preaching (ayyy)
I’m waking up on beaches (beaches)
Hair full of sequins (sequins)
If I should ever die
I want a pyramid in Egypt
And I’m the realest (I'm the realest)
It’s alright to be jealous yuh
Feeling so angelic
Spiral stairway to Heaven yuh
I just can’t be modest (no)
I’m a goddess draped in velvet
It’s not my fault I’m super duper fly I just can’t help
And I feel
WIYULD WIYULD WHY
AND I FEEL
WIYULD WIYULD WHY WHY (yuh yuh yuh)
Ew, Evann
Why are you so big headed
You’re so overconfident and I’m intimated
Well
How else would you expect my big, fat, juicy brain to fit into my skull?
I have to have a bit of a nugget as you can understand
And that’s alright I think
Yeah, that’s alright
I think
That’s alrightEmbed
