In Your Arms Lyrics
You call me lyin' and say "lie beside me always"
As if the truth belonged to nothing
Except you, my only darling
And if fits and storms don't bring us home
Then I won't be a sailor
'Cause this bed we've made's an ocean and I lie in it to be safe

She said "I am a wonderer, I wonder 'bout you always
What's a feeeling, but emotion that is stealing something greaterAnd I won't decide to leave ya 'till I hear the morning breakage.
Brush acrossed my brow and then somehow I'll find a way to take ya".

So just hold
Me in your arms, don't let me go
Don't let me go, besides you know I never will
It won't be long, the night is long
The night is long and I'm afraid of that still

The night is open as the sky looks through my window
While the sirens in the distance sing "remember being single?"
That you tied me to the master poll I left behind, it's certain
You're the closest, you're the closest, you're the closest, you're the furthest.
So just hold
Me in your arms, don't let me go
Don't let me go, besides you know I never will
It won't be long, the night is long.
The night is long and I will lay beside you
Hold me in your arms
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Besides you know I never will
It won't be long, the night is long
The night is long and I'm afraid of that still
(I'm afraid of all that still)Embed
