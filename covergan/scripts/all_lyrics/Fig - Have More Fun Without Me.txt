Have More Fun Without Me Lyrics
Rusty
Rusty old bike on the sidewalk
Collecting dust
Missing the fun
Waiting
Waiting for someone to answer
Scrolling up
To blame myself for what

White LCD
Taking our priorities
The smiles on the screen
Just get out and leave

Where did all these people go
Am I the only one at home 
Do they all hate my company
That's why I'm sitting here, letting the sounds of the TV
Drown out
Have more fun without me
Drown out
Have more fun without me
Sunny
Sunny lights catch on the window
Makes me bleed
It doesn't notice me
Mamma
Mamma just wants us to get out
Makes you weep 
As she gets up and leaves

Hey there's a beach
Look at all those pretty shades of blue
The breeze is slowly slowly coming through
But all I really really wanna do
Is send a pic and give it all to you

Where did all these people go
Am I the only one at home 
Do they all hate my company
That's why I'm sitting here, letting the sounds of the TV
Drown out
Have more fun without me
Drown out
Have more fun without me
Drown out
Have more fun without me
Drown out
Have more fun without me1Embed
