Bad Habit Lyrics
It’s 2 A.M who’s that ringing my phone?
It’s you explaining why you don’t wanna be alone
Now I should hang up, after what you put me through
There’s no reason for me to talk to you

Except that no one else makes me feel the way you do
It’s a shame boy, but my heart is hooked on you
Ah well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
But it’s your love that thrills me to no end

I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
Bad bad habit baby
Bad bad habit baby
It’s 8 A.M who’s knocking at my door?
It’s a lady for you, boy, now I can’t take no more
She says that you’re her man, that she came to take you home
Didn’t you tell me that you were all along

And while there’s no one else makes me feel the way you do
It’s a shame boy, but my heart is hooked on you
Well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
But it’s your love that thrills me to no end

I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you

Well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
But it’s your love that thrills me to no end

I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
And baby it’s you
Baby it’s you
Bad bad habit baby
Bad bad habit babyEmbed
