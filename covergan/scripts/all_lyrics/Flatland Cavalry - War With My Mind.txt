War With My Mind Lyrics
I feel like a prisoner doin' my time
Behind bars of regret relivin' my crimes
Down in the trenches at war with my mind
Losin' myself and my will to fight

Lost in a maze that ain't got an exit
Stuck in a phase of bad habits I can't quit
Run out of faith and I can't see the light
Down in the trenches at war with my mind

I can't put my thumb on the hour or day
When all of the colors faded to gray
Turned to pills to get high when the wine lost its taste
To drift through the sadness and the meaningless haze

Lost in a maze that ain't got an exit
Stuck in a phase of bad habits I can't quit
Run out of faith and I can't see the light
Down in the trenches at war with my mind

When your'e all out of reason and needin' a rhyme
To the song your heart's singin' and you can't find the line
I've come to know all good things come with my time
Keep fightin' the battle, the war with your mind
Keep fightin' the battle, the war with your mindEmbed
