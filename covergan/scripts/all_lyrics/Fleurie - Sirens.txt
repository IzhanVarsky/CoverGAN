Sirens Lyrics
Out in the darkness I saw an angel
Held back the flood, until the sky fell
I see the future covered in roses
Waves of gold as the door closes

I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens

After the fire drove out the sparrows
All of the clouds hang like gallows
Hey are you listening? I cannot reach you
I'm on the other side, trying to break through

I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens
I can hear the sirens (15x)4Embed
