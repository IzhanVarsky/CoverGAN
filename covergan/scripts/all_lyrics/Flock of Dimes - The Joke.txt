The Joke LyricsThe young, the old, the dead
And you and I presently traveling west
Chasing the sun
See where once it was
It will be again
And I have lived a charmed life
The hand of fate rests on my shoulder
Still I get the joke
Try to make you laugh
It speaks for itself
The child I’ll never have
The stranger on the sidewalk
All who’ve ever lived
Now are waking up
To wish us luckEmbed
