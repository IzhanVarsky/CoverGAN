20:25 Lyrics
It takes up time to pretend
But I don’t know what I want to do
Where do we go at the end?
I still don’t know what I want to do
You don’t have to-


You don’t have fear no more
You don’t have to fear at all
Take a breath and beat ‘em all
It’s okay to be alone
Let me be alone
Let me be alone
(Just want to be alone)
You don’t have fear no more
(Just want to be alone)
Take a breath and beat ‘em all

It takes up time to pretend
But I don’t know what I want to do
Where do we go at the end?
You don’t have fear no more
You don’t have to fear at all
Take a breath and beat ‘em all
It’s okay to be alone
Let me be alone
Let me be alone
(Just want to be alone)
(Just want to be alone)
(Just want to be alone)

You don’t have to fear no more
(I just want to be alone)
Take a breath and beat ‘em allEmbed
