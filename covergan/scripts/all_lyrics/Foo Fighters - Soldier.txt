Soldier LyricsCalling on you, belladonna
Poison to prepare
Now you're gone I float along
Like embers in the air
How could you understand?
Rain your armies down upon me
March across my back
Now or never, no surrender
Until your flag goes black
How could you understand?
How could you understand?
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Under attack again
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Under attack
Under attack again
On your orders, bricks and mortar
Kingdoms to defend
Saints and sinners make good prisoners
Now your king is dead
How could you understand?
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Under attack again
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Under attack
Under attack again
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Under attack again
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack again1Embed
