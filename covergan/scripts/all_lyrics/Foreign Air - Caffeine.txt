Caffeine Lyrics
Eat your love, girl I had to
Spandex, leather hat, no tattoos
I am mad all about you
Call it drugs, call it caffeine
Call it lust, call it sexy
I look sad, but I’m happy

And you have got me high
All the other times
But I’ve been falling down, down so hard

I need your love
Need your love (7x)

I got secrets I can’t control
Just like seeds you know they’ll grow
Hidden lies between the lines
You never know what you will find

And you have got me high
All the other times
But I’ve been falling down, down so hard
I need your love
Need your love (7x)
I need your love (3x)

I’m sick and tired of breathing in
But I’ll take a drag
All your words have got my mind in a knot
With all your loving and leaving
You’re loving and leaving
I still can’t stop thinking
Still can’t stop thinking

I need your love
Need your love (7x)Embed
