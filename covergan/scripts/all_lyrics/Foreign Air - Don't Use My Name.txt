Don’t Use My Name LyricsI was in your corner
Gave you the good life
You went and turned on me
Cruising through red lights
You’re losing your head
I gave you everything you wanted
You should be careful now because I got my eye on you
No tears will be shed tonight
No tears when you feel the knife
No tears when you see the light
Don't use my name, use my name
Get it out ya mouth
Don’t use my name, use my name
Listen to me now
Don't use my name, use my name
Get it out ya mouth
Don’t use my name, use my name
Listen to me now
Don’t tell me that the truth lies
You’ve only seen my good side
This is my final warning
Don’t believe you’re that important
You’re losing your head
I gave you everything that you wanted
You need to be careful now because I got my eyes on you
No tears will be shed tonight
No tears when you feel the knife
No tears when you see the light
Don't use my name, use my name
Get it out ya mouth
Don’t use my name, use my name
Listen to me now
Don't use my name, use my name
Get it out ya mouth
Don’t use my name, use my name
Oh, ropes are tied
Tied so tight
I feel inspired
And there’s no redemption
There’s no redemption
There’s no redemption
There’s no redemption
I got my eye on you
I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
Don't use my name, use my name
Get it out ya mouth
Don’t use my name, use my name
Listen to me now
Don't use my name, use my name
Get it out ya mouth
Don’t use my name, use my name
Listen to me now
Ropes are tied
Tied so tight
I feel inspired
And there’s no redemption
There’s no redemptionEmbed
