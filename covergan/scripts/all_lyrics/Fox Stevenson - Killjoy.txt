Killjoy Lyrics
Can't take it it’s mine
It was mine to find
I'll do what I can
To keep it alive
And all in all I
Try to survive
I'll do what I have to
To protect with my life
Like watching the light
Leaving your eyes
Twisting the knife
Trying not to smile

No, I’m not the man who does these dark things
Something inside me I think is drowning
Something in my blood that's unfamiliar
Either I'm the host, or in control

Salt the earth, prove your worth
I got a reputation as a killjoy
Killjoy
Oil and dust, blood and rust
Can't stop feeling that killjoy
Killjoy
Hammer down, no more sound
High off the fumes of this killjoy
Killjoy
I watched the life leave his eyes
Man, I'm so addicted to the killjoy
Killjoy
Can't take it it's mine
It was mine to find
I do what I can
To keep it alive
Taking you home
To keep you alive
To keep you alive
To keep you alive2Embed
