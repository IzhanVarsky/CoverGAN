Turn It Up (Higher) Lyrics
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!

If you feel like it's over
Where nothing seems right no more
And you're in need of something new
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Hey!)

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!

We've gone too far
And now we don't know where we are
But I'll blame it all on you
We move too slow
We need invigorating
And I think I know just what to do
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Hey!)

If you feel like it's over
Where nothing seems right no more
And you're in need of something new
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
And if's too much to handle
And you think you've been here before
Well then there's only one thing to do
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
So let's progress
We'll be much better than the rest
And we can blaze a trail ahead
What we become
Will be determined by the things we will have done
And we can conquer them instead
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Hey!)

If you feel like it's over
Where nothing seems right no more
And you're in need of something new
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
And if's too much to handle
And you think you've been here before
Well then there's only one thing to do
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!

You have got to realize
I've been trying, oh, so hard
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!)
I've lost my arms and legs and eyes and ears to you
My brain, my soul, my dreams, my life
What should I do?
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Hey!)

If you feel like it's over
Where nothing seems right no more
And you're in need of something new
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
And if's too much to handle
And you think you've been here before
Well then there's only one thing to do
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!2Embed
