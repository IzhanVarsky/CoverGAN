Friday Lyrics
Friday night, I watch her clean her room
I love and hate her at the same time
I wanna get her out the mess she's in
But she don't ever wanna come to mine
Friday night, she stays at home
She wanna tell me how she's getting on fine
She's so lazy and I don't get why
She's looking to get me high

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
High
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
High
(Whatever she holds against me)
High
(Whatever she holds against me)
High, high
High

I don't think I'll be seeing her again
But still lovе her with all of my heart
Maybe onе day she'll listen what I've been saying
But I don't wanna make it long
I gotta close all the roads to her
So I could really be moving on
I'm sorry how I did
But I don't think me and you work anymore
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
High
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
High
(Whatever she holds against me)
High
(Whatever she holds against me)Embed
