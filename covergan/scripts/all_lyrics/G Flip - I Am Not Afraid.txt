I Am Not Afraid Lyrics
I am fine feeling lonely
I found comfort in what's here
You know I don't mind that you're out the door
I picked myself up off the fucking floor
Yeah, this here, baby, this here, babe, ain't love

So take me as I am, watch me as I go
I've been sailing seas ‘fore you jumped afloat
And now you're standing on the sidewalk
Calling Georgia to come alive
But she's been dead the whole time
And I tried, and I cried

I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
And I've cried
I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home

Don't care if you don't like me
You know you're full of shit
I'm standing on two feet now
It was hard to admit
You were part of my story
A world that we had built
But I have overcome it
And acknowledge that you were not safe to love, so
I'll run with the wind and I'll grow
A set of wings and free fall
Into my world where I own all
So take me as I am, watch me as I go
I've been sailing seas ‘fore you jumped afloat
And now you're standing on the sidewalk
Calling Georgia to come alive
(But she's been dead the whole time)

I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
And I've cried
I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home

Changing love, changing love changed me
Changing love, changing love changed me
Yeah, I have lost all that I had found
Picked myself up off the fucking ground
Yeah, this here, baby, this here, babe, ain't love
Love, love

I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
I am not afraid to do this alone
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
I am not afraid to do this alone (And I've tried)
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
I am not afraid to do this alone (And I've cried)
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
And I've tried (Changing)
And I've cried (Changing)Embed
