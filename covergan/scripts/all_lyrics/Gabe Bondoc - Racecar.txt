Racecar Lyrics
Chest out, I'm trying to go through everything
Night out, I feel the pressure pressing me
Just keep doubling down
And just keep pushing it down
Hot mess, just look at what she does to you
Deep breath, she already said yes to you
Just keep doubling down
And just keep pushing it down

I'm as afraid as I've ever been
In this little car that you'll be sitting in
'Cause you're a race car
Racing away with my heart

Ooh-ooh
'Cause you got everything I like
Hoping by the end of tonight
That I can finally call you mine
Call you all mine (My little race car)
Ooh-ooh
'Cause you got everything I like
Hoping by the end of tonight
That I can finally call you mine
Call you all mine (My little race car)
Skin tight, those jeans are really killin' me
Highlights, I'm staring but I'm listening
You keep knocking me out
I'll just be here on the ground
That smile could light the whole city twice
We talked through the rhythm and the blues tonight
I'll keep doubling down
If you keep laughing out loud

This is as good as I've ever been
In this little car we've been sitting in
You're such a race car
Racing away with my heart

Ooh-ooh
'Cause you got everything I like
Hoping by the end of tonight
That I can finally call you mine
Call you all mine (My little race car)
Ooh-ooh
'Cause you got everything I like
Hoping by the end of tonight
That I can finally call you mine
Call you all mine (My little race car)
This is as good as I've been
In this car that we've been riding in
Eyes on the road, distracted
It's a two-way street where it's happenin'
This is as good as I've been
In this car that we've been riding in
Eyes on the road, distracted
It's a two-way street

Ooh-ooh
'Cause you got everything I like
Hoping by the end of tonight
That I can finally call you mine
Call you all mine (My little race car)
Ooh-ooh
'Cause you got everything I like
Hoping by the end of tonight
That I can finally call you mine
Call you all mine (My little race car)Embed
