The One Lyrics
The way you laugh with your mouth closed
The way you smile so your eyes glow
It's in the way you look at me
So I can see just who I am inside
The way my heart doesn't listen
And so it just keeps wishing
Wishing you were close to me so that its beat
Will synchronize with yours

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, now
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me

You're my hero and my best friend
And girl I swear you're a godsend
Lovely as a ray of sun, the very first one
Just as the day begins
So I got a round trip ticket
But I don't wanna take it
I only wanna take half
And give the other half to somebody
Who won't waste it, now
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, now
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, now

Your hand and mine
Fit perfectly fine
And sway below our waists
At the perfect height
Faithful and true
To Him and to you
I will stay
Forever this way because

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, now
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, nowEmbed
