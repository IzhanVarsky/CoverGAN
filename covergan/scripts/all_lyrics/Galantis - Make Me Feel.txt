Make Me Feel Lyrics
Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel
The way you make me feel
There's nothing else this real
I could stand here forever
I could stand here forever

6 o'clock again
The night is at an end
In the quietness
Into your love, I feel
When the winter's gone
When I come undone
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel

The way you make me feel
There's nothing else this real
I could stand here forever
I could stand here forever
The way you make me feel
There's nothing else this real
I could stand here forever
I could stand here forever
Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel
There's nothing else this real
6 o'clock again
The night is at an end
In the quietness
Into your love, I feel
When the winter's gone
When I come undone
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel

The way you make me feel
There's nothing else this real
I could stand here forever
I could stand here forever
The way you make me feel
There's nothing else this real
I could stand here forever
I could stand here forever
Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel
There's nothing else this real

Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feelEmbed
