Here To Stay Lyrics(Here's another one)
Come on
I'm here to stay baby
For me there's no mucking 'round
I do this purely for music
Never for the money or fame
I'm blessed with this music
It's my one heart desire
Surely music takes me higher
To another place I've never been before
(General Fiyah, watch it man!)
I miss around come quick nobody tell me what they think
Now don't ever forget why we do this music
Not for the popularity, money other things
Ya purely cause we have the passion for the music
The drum and the bass make you move your waist
Meanwhile this reggae music takes you to a higher place
Come and dance up and down
Come and do the rubber duck
Come join the fun there's room for everyone
No room for hate leave your troubles at the gate
General Fiyah on the rhythm, THD got you moving
I'm here to stay baby
For me there's no mucking 'round
I do this purely for music
Never for the money or fame
I'm blessed with this music
It's my one heart desire
Surely music takes me higher
To a place I've never been before
Woah, woah woah
(it's a funny thing, you know)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I'm here to stay baby
For me there's no mucking 'round
I do this purely for music
Never for the money or fame
I'm blessed with this music
It's my one heart desire
Surely music takes me higher
To a place I've never been before
(General Fiyah, watch it man!)
I miss around come quick nobody tell me what they think
Now don't ever forget why we do this music
Not for the popularity, money other things
Ya purely cause we have the passion for the music
The drum and the bass make you move your waist
Meanwhile this reggae music takes you to a higher place
Come and dance up and down
Come and do the rubber duck
Come join the fun there's room for everyone
No room for hate leave your troubles at the gate
General Fiyah on the rhythm, THD got you moving
General Fiyah, ha
Watch it manEmbed
