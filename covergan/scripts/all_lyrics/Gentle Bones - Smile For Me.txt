Smile For Me Lyrics
Smile for me
It's easier on the heart
Can you see, everything you are?
And trust me
It's more than they can explain

But there will come
A time when you're in the ground
And I'll come
So what is so wrong right now?
You'll soon be
All the love that is in the pain

Cause I just know it wil be alright
My dear best friend
Wish you live your life in the best way
When I think of you at some point in the day

There is no paradise
We'll make this our heaven on earth
And so much more than what you are looking for
You'll see
It's a beautiful night so please don't fall asleep
Remember wherever you go
There're some things that only you know
We'll open doors that we have yet to explore
Come with me
It's a beautiful night so please don't fall asleep
Smile for me
I see us on a boat out on this open sea
When the sun has set
The stars are all we'll ever need
You and me, the seven seas

And I just it'll be alright
My dear best friend
Wish you live your life in the best way
When I think of you at some point in the day

There is no paradise
We'll make this our heaven on earth
And so much more than what you are looking for
You'll see
It's a beautiful night so please don't fall asleep
Remember wherever you go
There're some things that only you know
We'll open doors that we have yet to explore
Come with me
It's a beautiful night so please don't fall asleepEmbed
