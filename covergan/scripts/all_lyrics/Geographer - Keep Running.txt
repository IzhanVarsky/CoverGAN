Keep Running Lyrics
Turn, turn it all into love
Wondering where to go
You don't know where you are
You follow them into their hearts
Wonder have they always been there
Will they ever fall
First they tell you to walk
Then they tell you to crawl
Like telling you to fight a war
Without knowing the cause
Someone pulls the lock
Cold against their palm
Fear is like a key inside you
Turning in your heart

I know that you'll carry
I know that you'll carry me home
Baby it's scary
But I don't think that's where we belong

You gotta' just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on, on, nеver letting up
You gotta' just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on, on, nevеr letting up

Rising, above it all
Looking down on them
Like a fly upon the wall
I built you, palace in my thoughts
Because I know we won't be here for long
We aren't here at all

I know that you'll carry
I know that you'll carry me home
Baby it's scary
But I don't think that's where we below

You gotta' just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on, on never letting up
Just keep running on
Just keep running on
Just keep running on, on never letting up
First they tell you to learn
Then they tell you you're wrong
Then they tell you to live a lie
If you want to live at all
Take away your reasons
They take you for a fool
Said there's no point in living now
Even if you could

You're running now
You're running now
You're running now
You're running now
You're running now
You're running now1Embed
