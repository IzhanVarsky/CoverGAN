Slave to the Rhythm Lyrics
You light up the fire, they just watch it burn
A gentle violence, they can take their turn
We all belong
Somewhere to someone
You can't give them somethin' they won't take
You won't know you're dreamin' until you're awake
We all belong
Somewhere to someone

You're a slave to the rhythm, slave to the light
And you know you gotta give it to 'em every night
They'll change your life
You're a slave to the rhythm, slave to the light
And you know you gotta give it to 'em every night
They'll make you mine

You're a slave to the rhythm, slave to the light
And you know you gotta give it to 'em every night
They'll change your life
You're a slave to the rhythm, slave to the light
And you know you gotta give it to 'em every night
They'll make you mineEmbed
