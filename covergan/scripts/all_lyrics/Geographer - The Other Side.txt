The Other Side Lyrics
It isn't life if you live it alone
You get lost in the undertow
You give it time and then you'll know
Love is holy
It's still yours if you give it away
But you'll lose it forever if you make them pay
I keep the promises you don't make
'Cause love is holy

I told you once
And I told you twice
Nobody knows where we go when we die

But I will try
To meet you on the other side
I will try
To meet you on the other side
I will try
On the other side

It isn't life if you never belong
You'll try to try out song
But all you wanna do is sing along
'Causе love is holy
It isn't life if you don't have a homе
Like a story, no one told
Maybe I was never really yours
Love is holy

You told me once
And you told me twice
Nobody knows where we go when we die

But I will try
To meet you on the other side
I will try
To meet you on the other side
I will try
Oh on the other side

This is all we know
There's nowhere else to go
This is all she wrote
We're on our own
We're on our own
But you know I'll try
To meet you on the other side
You know I'll try
To meet you on the other side
(I told you once)
(And I told you twice)
(Nobody knows where we go when we die)
On the other sideEmbed
