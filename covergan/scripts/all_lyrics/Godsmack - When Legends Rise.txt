When Legends Rise Lyrics
Legs are tired, these hands are broken
Alone I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall the legends rise

My throat is dry, my vision's fading
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
Taking time just one step forward
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall the legends rise

Whoa
Legends rise
Whoa
Legends rise (Legends rise, rise, rise)
Legends rise (Rise, rise, rise, rise)
You gonna do somethin' about it
Or just stand there and bleed?
Legends rise

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall the legends rise

Whoa
Legends rise
Whoa
