Delicious Lyrics
Just delicious
Just delicious
Just delicious

That first taste
Must have been about a half hour delay
Before my conscious mind
Recovered wings, took to the sky
I was a million miles away
Just delicious
It was just so damn delicious
Just delicious
You know that feeling, right?
You know you got time

Just delicious
Just delicious
Just delicious (Uh)
Just delicious
Just delicious
You know that feeling, right?
Just delicious
Just delicious
That was just so delicious (Uh)
Just delicious
Just delicious
Couldn't feel my feet
But I knew they were still dancing right beneath my knees
It was my destiny to devour life like sweets and candy
’Bout an hour passed
And I was cruising up the highway
Felt the wind at last
I could succumb or do it my way
And as I feel the sea beneath my knees
My thoughts and conscience oceans deep
This trip, to fall would be defeat
But I'll let the waves come over me
Till I couldn't breathe again (Till I couldn’t breathe again)
It was just so delicious, man
Oh, it's so good

Just delicious
Just delicious
You know I gotta get some more of that, man (Uh)
Just delicious
Just delicious

Just deliciousEmbed
