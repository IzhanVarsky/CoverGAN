Go Slow Lyrics
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show

Let's fall slowly, love
Let's not fall apart
'Cause I've done this before
And I know, I know

And I don't wanna live life blind to the bruises
I just wanna make sure that you're prepared
And I don't wanna fuss or fight 'cause it's useless
Nothing ever felt this right, but I'm scared

Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we're falling, can't help but let it show
Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we're falling, can't help but let it show
Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we're falling, can’t help but let it show
Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we're falling
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show

All things fall apart
When two broken hearts
Can't get through the dark
On their own, just go slow, yeah

And I don't wanna live life blind to the bruises
I just wanna make sure that you're prepared
And I don't wanna fuss or fight 'cause it's useless
Nothing ever felt this right, but I'm scared

Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we’re falling, can’t help but let it show
Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we're falling, can't help but let it show
Go slow, we should take it slow
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Go, go, we should let it go
Admit we're falling
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show
We should let it show1Embed
