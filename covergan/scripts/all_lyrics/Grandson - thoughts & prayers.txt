​​thoughts & prayers Lyrics
(No thoughts, no prayers)
(Can bring back what's no longer there)
(The silent are damned)
(The body count is on your hands)

Smile for the camera
Another politician bought
I swear I heard another shot
Cash another payment
Red all on the canvas
It's murder on the campus
Another press conference
Nothing gets accomplished
The suit is an accomplice
Money is the motive
The war is in the street
Watch history repeat

No thoughts and no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

They lobby for the violence
It's a governmental shakedown
Welcome to my breakdown
Bulletproof backpacks
They wanna arm the teachers
I think I saw the reaper
Fear's good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lyin' to the masses
How much will it take
'Til you get buried in the coffin that you make?
Heaven's sake
No thoughts, and no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

Turn off all the lights, nobody make a sound
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
Are we out of time?
Can we turn this all around?
Are we out of time?
Will we all fall?
(We all fall down)
The body count is on your hands
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts (no thoughts)
No prayers (no prayers)
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts (no thoughts)
No prayers (no prayers)
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands (on your hands)24Embed
