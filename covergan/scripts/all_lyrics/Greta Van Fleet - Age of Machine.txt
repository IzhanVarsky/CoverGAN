Age of Machine Lyrics
Perfect child
Plugged in since the womb
Prophet of the dune
In this electric tomb
Man has made
An omnipresent force
Heading on a course
For interstellar shores

God machine
Malfunctioned as it grew
And the circuits blew
Falling down on you
Now you're free
Unplug from the source
No more underscores
Open up the doors

Feeling
Oh God, the feeling
We need some healing
We need some healing
God knows if you feel defeated
You have been cheated
You have retreated

Feeling
Oh God, the feeling
We need some healing
We need some healing
God knows if you feel defeated
You have been cheated
You have retreated5Embed
