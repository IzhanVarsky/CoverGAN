Dancing on My Own Lyrics
Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
It's a big black sky over my town
I know where you at, I bet she's around

Yeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)
So far away, but still so near
(The lights go on, the music dies)
But you don't see me standing here
(I just came to say goodbye)

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)

I keep dancing on my ownEmbed
