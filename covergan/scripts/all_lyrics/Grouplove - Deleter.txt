Deleter Lyrics
One, two, three, go

Yeah, the carwash
And the airplanes, and the highways
We've been here for too long, for too long
Am I anxious or just modern?
All this darkness
Been going on too long, for too long
Yeah, yeah, yeah

All this time I thought you were a leader
It turns out you're only a deleter
Tell your friends that you're okay
You're never gonna see them anyway
All this time I thought you were a leader
It turns out you're only a deleter
No, no, no, no
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no
No, no
Yeah, yeah

It's the future and I'm braindead
Yeah, I'm destitute, yeah, I feel no roots anymore, anymore
Take another picture (Picture)
Show 'em what you're doing (Doing)
And how we built a lighthouse
Out of all these godforsaken ruins
We know it's coming
None of this can live
The world will recover once you put us in the past, yeah
All this time I thought you were a leader
It turns out you're only a deleter
Tell your friends that you're okay
You're never gonna see them anyway
All this time I thought you were a leader
It turns out you're only a deleter
No, no, no, no
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no
No, no
Yeah, yeah

I don't know
Where to go
Bring the pain
Bring the pain, my baby
I just know, I know you're gonna let me out
So bring the pain
Nothing really matters anymore, my baby

All this time I'm burning with a fever
It turns out I've always been my healer
No, no, no, no
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
All this time I thought you were a leader
It turns out you're only a deleter
No, no, no, no
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no
No, no
Yeah, yeah1Embed
