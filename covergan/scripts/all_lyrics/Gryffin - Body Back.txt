Body Back Lyrics
Who cares what the world's gonna say?
'Cause you know they're gonna say it anyway
(And I know, and I know that)
Who cares if they laugh at what we do?
'Cause it's only me and you that know the truth
(And I know, and I know that)

Middle finger to the sky
They don't know 'bout you and I
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
Even though I broke your heart
No, that won't keep us apart
Baby, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up

If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
Don't know why I do this
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
(And I know, and I know that)
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
I, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
(And I know, and I know that)
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
Baby, bring your body back to me

Who cares what the world's gonna think?
'Cause you know they're gonna think it anyway
(And I know, and I know that)
I love all the bad things that we do
Shut your mouth and put your hands where I want you to (Want you to)
(And I know, and I know that)

Middle finger to the sky
They don't know 'bout you and I
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
Even though I broke your heart
No, that won't keep us apart
Baby, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up

If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
Don't know why I do this
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
(And I know, and I know that)
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
I, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
(And I know, and I know that)
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
Baby, bring your body back to me

If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish, stupid
Don't know why I do this
Baby, bring your body, baby, bring your

If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
Don't know why I do this
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to meEmbed
