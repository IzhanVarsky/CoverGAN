Hold You Tonight Lyrics
Lipstick on the bottle
That you left next to my bed
The makeup on my pillow
Reminds me you were there
Try to tell my friends what you do
But it's too hard to describe
'Cause everything about you is better in real life

Get up out of my head
Get up out of my mind
So come and fall into my arms
And let me hold you tonight
You got my heart in your hands
And it just feels right
So come and fall into my arms
And let me hold you tonight

Let me, let me hold you
Let me hold you tonight

Yeah, when it's late and I'm lonely
And I've had a few drinks
It sure hit a lot stronger, baby
If you were here with me
Mmm, are you up, or are you sleepin'?
Can you be on your way?
Mmm, 'cause I ain't stop thinkin'
'Bout last night all day
Get up out of my head
Get up out of my mind
So come and fall into my arms
And let me hold you tonight
You got my heart in your hands
And it just feels right
So come and fall into my arms
And let me hold you tonight

Let me, let me hold you
Let me hold you tonight
Woah, no
Let me, let me hold you
Let me hold you tonight

I've got hours to give
You should use 'em
All those clothes you're in
You should lose 'em
All those plans you had
Make some new ones
Oh, 'cause this time
I'm gonna take my time
Get up out of my head
Get up out of my mind
And come and fall into my arms
And let me hold you tonight
You got my heart in your hands
And it just feels right
So come and fall into my arms
And let me hold you tonight

Oh, come on
Let me, let me hold you
Let me hold you tonight
Woah, no, no
Let me, let me hold you
Let me hold you tonight

Let me hold you tonight
Please let me hold you tonight1Embed
