Good Vibes Lyrics
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like
So I don't you need you raining on my parade
Throwing shade
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life

I know life will never be perfect
But the sunshine, it feels like I deserve it
You, yeah, you, why you coming over here with your cloud?
You, yeah, you, why you always trying to bring my mood down?

I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like
So I don't you need you raining on my parade
Throwing shade
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
So I'm here with a brighter perspective
So I really ain't tryna be stressing, ooh
You, yeah, you, why you coming over here cold as ice?
Why? Why? Boo-hoo, a little optimism can be so nice
Maybe, if you wasn't being so shady
Throwing venom everywhere daily
You could chill, you could hang
But you ain't on that high

I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like
So I don't you need you raining (I don't) on my parade (Parade)
Throwing shade (Shade)
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life

Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, good vibes
I only want
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, good vibes
I only want
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, good vibes
(Good, good, good vibes)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, good vibes
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like (I like)
So I don't you need you raining on my parade (Parade)
Throwing shade (Shade)
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes (Good vibes) 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life

Oh, I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
Oh, I only want good vibes 'round me tonightEmbed
