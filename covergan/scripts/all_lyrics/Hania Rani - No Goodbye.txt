No Goodbye LyricsSomeways (Someways, someways, someways)
Someways (Someways, someways, someways)
Lie, I will wait for better times
Standing here guarding your arms tonight
Lie, close your eyes, forget you saw
Hold me tight before we say goodbye
Goodbye
Still I will say goodbye
It's a lie we 
Still I will say goodbye
It's a lie, we say goodbye
It's a lie we 
It's a lie, we stay tonight
Alone
It's a lie we say (It's a lie we say) tonight
Tonight
It's a lie
Sign of the end of time you never seen before
It's a lie, we say goodbye
Goodbye
Scars on the broken heart will never tear again
It's a fight to stay aliveEmbed
