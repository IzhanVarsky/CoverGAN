How Do You Do? Lyrics
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again

When you wake me in the morning
That is my favourite thing
The party is so warming
As it strikes a chord upon my skin
Now you sing in the evening
With the voice that's bouncing like a spring
A heart is not for breaking
It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin
It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin

How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
(How do you do the thing you do, the thing you do?)
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
(How do you do the thing you do, the thing you do?)
You make me want to live again
Have we taken all we're good for?
Have we registered our love in vain?
A church is not for praying
It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane
(It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane)
It's for celebrating the light that shines through the pane
(It's for celebrating the light that shines through the pane)
It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane

How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
(How do you do the thing you do, the thing you do?)
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again

(You make me want to live again)
If you won't answer, who should I ask?
(You make me want to live again)
If you won't answer, who should I ask?
(You make me want to live again)
If you won't answer, who should I ask?
(How do you do that thing you do, that thing you do?)
If you won't answer, who should I ask?Embed
