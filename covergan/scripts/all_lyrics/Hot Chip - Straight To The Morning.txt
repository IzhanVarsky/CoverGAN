Straight to the Morning Lyrics
Straight to the morning

Well, there's a ringing in my ears
But there's the devil on my tongue
Feel like I ain't been out in years
But when I'm with you, it's too much fun

Rollin' the dice tonight
Not gonna fuss or fight
We're going out tonight

Straight to the morning
The fever will never end
Straight to the morning
When we can just start again
Straight to the morning (Straight to the morning)

You're always never, never, ever stopping
Start all over again (Straight to the morning)
You're always never, never, ever stopping
You're always edging up the gears
But never measure what we've done
Well, there's a pleasure in this fear
That we might never see the sun

Rolling the dice tonight (Rolling the dice tonight)
Not gonna fuss or fight (I'm not gonna fuss or fight)
We're going out tonight (We're going out tonight, alright)

Straight to the morning (Straight to the morning)
The fever will never end (The fever will never end)
Straight to the morning (Straight to the morning)
When we can just start again (When we can just start again)
Straight to the morning

You're always never, never, ever stopping
Start all over again
You're always never, never, ever stopping

I pick you up at half past ten
I see you move by eleven
I feel the heat, let's cut the lights
It's a small slice of heaven
We've only just begun
We've just begun to get it on
Follow me, we'll go straight through (Oh)
Straight through until the break of dawn

Straight to the morning
The fever will never end
Straight to the morning
When we can just start again

Going straight to the morning, yeah, oh
You're always never, never, ever stopping
I'm straight to the morning
You're always never, never, ever stopping
Start all over againEmbed
