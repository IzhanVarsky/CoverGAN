Bind Lyrics
Sweetheart, I'm honest
You’re open, I hold the Sun
New eyes, I need it
I hold down the motions
And reach out in waterfalls
I'm easy to come undone

I'm holding out
Holding out the knot
Opened up
Before we bind
I’m holding out
Healing oceans now
You hold your love
Before we bind

These hearts are open
I reach in and come undone
New eyes, I need it

I'm holding out
Holding out the knot
Opened up
Before we bind
I'm holding out
Healing oceans now
You hold your love
Before we bind
Before we bind
Before we bind
Before we bind
Before we bind1Embed
