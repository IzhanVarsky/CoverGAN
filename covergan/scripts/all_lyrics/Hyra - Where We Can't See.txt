Where We Can’t See LyricsYou can back it up into me
Lte me twist it down into the depths
We we can’t see, boy
Slipping further, ten meters deep
So intoxicated, I’m feeling a little weak, oh
And I’ll be sweet to you
Far from anything cruel
Focus on us two
We could take it slowly
Hold it, hold it
Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
Hold it, hold it
Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
I can hold it for a moment
You could stick around as long as I’m there
Be real, you liking where it’s going
The depths we you can’t see, boy
Here I lie, reminded of your kiss
Seeped into my mind
Tearing my heart to smaller pieces
Poisonous, it cuts down on me
Hurt my reasoning
Took me away to fantasy, oh
And I’ll be sweet to you
Far from anything cruel
Focus on us two
We could take it slowly
Hold it, hold it
Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
Hold it, hold it
Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
Hold it, hold it
Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
Hold it, hold it
Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)Embed
