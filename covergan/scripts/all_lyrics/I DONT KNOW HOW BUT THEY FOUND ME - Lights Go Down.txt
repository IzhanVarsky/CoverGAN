Lights Go Down Lyrics
Hello
Pardon me if I forget your name
Well, not every hollow is sleepy as this one
But heads roll just the same
Oh lord
Dressed like you're so uptown (Town, town, town, town, town)
Parade through the ballrooms
Decay in your costumes and dance

Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down

Come now
Is that any way to talk to me?
Corrupting the young with your uncivil tongue
What a shame if you misspeak now
Somehow
Dance till the lights go down (Down, down, down, down, down)
It's curtains for you, join the back of the queue
And we'll break our necks like we do when the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Down, down
Shake when you haunt me like you were a ghost town


Oh no, what have we here?
Oh lord, the thief of the year!
Steal every heart from the boys that you're touching
And dance

Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go down
Until the lights go
(Oh no, what have we here?) Until the lights go down
(Oh lord, the thief of the year!) Until the lights go down
(Steal every heart from the boys that you're touching) Until the lights go down
And dance
Until the lights go down14Embed
