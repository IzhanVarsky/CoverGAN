Doesn’t Matter LyricsWalking down this street
Thinkin' 'bout you
Do you ever think about me too?
How could you just leave?
All those memories
I wish you could make mine do that too
Doesn't matter if I try
To run after you
You'd be flying away over and over
Even if I did try to reach across to you
You'd stick, running when the race is over
I don't know
Where life is headed to
But I know that it won't be you
I don't know
Where is life is headed to
But I know that it won't be you
Doesn't matter if I try
To run after you
You'd be flying away over and over
Even if I did try to reach across to you
You'd stick, running whеn the race is over
Doеsn't matter if I try
To run after you
You'd be flying away over and overEmbed
