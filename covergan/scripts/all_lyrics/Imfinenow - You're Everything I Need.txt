You’re Everything I Need Lyrics
I can say I love you
If you want me to
But if you want me to go
Then baby, I'll go
I'll cross any ocean
Walk any distance

Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you (Mmm)
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need (And everything I need)
'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I—

'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need
And everything I need
'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need
And everything I need
Do you remember
When we stayed up all night
Talking 'bout feelings
Lost track of time
I wish that I told you
Everything that I'm feeling for you
But I never did
Now I wish I was close to you

Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you (Mmm)
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you

'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need
And everything I need
'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need
And everything I need
'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need
And everything I need
'Cause you got everything I want
And everything I need
And everything I needEmbed
