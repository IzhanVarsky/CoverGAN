Just A Mistake Lyrics
Maybe if I just go to sleep
I won't feel the pain
Could you stand next to me?
To shelter me from the rain

I've been running away from problems
I knew  I would keep
Never knew it would be so hard
But you cut too deep
Why do I dream of you
Even when I'm awake
Why do I dream of you
When I know we were, just a mistake

Would you let me
See some things straight
Because lately
I can't see past my mistakes

I've been running away from problems
I knew  I would keep
Never knew it would be so hard
But you cut too deep
Why do I dream of you
Even when I'm awake
Why do I dream of you
When I know we were, just a mistakeEmbed
