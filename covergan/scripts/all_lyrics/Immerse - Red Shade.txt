Red Shade LyricsUnaware of the hate we feed
Overshadowed by the greed in our own lives
Nothing left but misery
So self indulged no one gives a fuck about anyone else
We’re moving too fast too fast too fast
‘Cause everybody’s so afraid to face the truth
And we’ve been living too long in the fast lane
Too deep got us being so heartless
Just hold on
Hold on to you
Sell your soul to envy and faceless ghosts
In the end you will know you’re nothing
There isn’t anybody here to help you
No more sympathy for the broken
Empathy
Has never seemed so fucking lost to me
Growing cold to the lives we lead
Faces start to feel, unfamiliar
This place is filled with so much hate
We’re moving too fast too fast too fast
‘Cause everybody’s so afraid to face the truth
And we’ve been living too long in the fast lane
Too deep got us being so heartless
Just hold on
Hold on to youEmbed
