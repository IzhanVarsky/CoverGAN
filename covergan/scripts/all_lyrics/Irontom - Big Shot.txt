Big Shot Lyrics
Hey!
Let's go!

I want your finger prints all over me
Cause if they find me dead they should know who it be
Who kicked me off the boat
Who threw me in the moat
To the gators so I never see nobody later

I love the danger (Yeah you do)
Don’t be a stranger (Hey I won't)
You want my body (Yeah I do)
Well now you got me

I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
And you said you never knew me
But I think you do
You always did, Kid, you know it’s true
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
I put ten sugar cubes in my root beer float
Refuse to be serious cause life is a joke
I don’t know a lot but I know what you got
Don’t be maybe baby come on I’m the big shot

I wanted danger (Yeah you did)
You was a stranger (I know I was)
You want my body (Yeah I do)
Well now you got me

I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
And you said you never knew me
But I think you do
You always did, Kid, you know it’s true
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense

Everybody sing
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
Yea kid I think you need to take a look in the mirror (Yeah you do)
Take that look in the mirror again
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense
And you said you never knew me
But I think you do
You always did, Kid, you know it’s true
I’m the big shot in your life now
I’m the one who makes sense

Everybody sing
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
La-da-dada-du-la-dada heyEmbed
