Keeping Busy LyricsEvery day, when I wake
Every day, I wish I could wake up to the sunlight creeping in
But I can't have the neighbors watch me sleeping in
In the night, I dim the lights
Every night, I become a fractal in the cloud that we're thinking through
I create the window and I paint the view
How're you feeling? How're you keeping yourself busy?
Are you keeping yourself busy?
If I can't keep, keep in touch now
I'll probably never, I don't wanna sever
It's all love, but I'll have priorities forever
And forever isn't permanent, it's 'til I change my mеntal
Until I get a chance to judge LA bеyond the weather
I'm hoping by the summer we can gather all together
Hoping I can plan instead of hoping for the better
Cuz part of me is thinking all this madness is a catalyst
The 20 somethings wanna keep it where the passion is
But keep me guessing, cuz if I learn the lesson
Then I might lose the drive to make the art from pure expression
Every day, when I wake
Every day, I wish I could wake up to the sunlight creeping in
But I can't have the neighbors watch me sleeping in
When the world spins again
Don't forget the feeling of the tremor that we all felt coming
(Tremor when you're waiting for a winner)
The separation of our lovingEmbed
