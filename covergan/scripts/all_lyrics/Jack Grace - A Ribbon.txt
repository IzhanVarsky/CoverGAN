A Ribbon LyricsVerse 1
Have you heard about it
Was on the Northside driving in
How we lost someone
They took another red brick dream
Said a prayer to get my hopes up
And that gets tangled in the wind
Chorus
And oh I feel nothing
When I’m out here on the wrong side of the road
And oh, you’re a ribbon
Of a modest cold suburbia we know
Verse 2
I want to call you call you, call you back
I said a couple things that I regret
But if you’re gone when I get off the road again
Then you know I only wish that you were therе
Said a prayer to get my hopes up
But thеy get twisted in the wind
Chorus
And oh I feel nothing
When I’m out here on the wrong side of the road
And oh, you’re a ribbon
Of the modest cold suburbia we know
And oh here’s to nothing
When I’m out here on the wrong side of the road
Cause oh, I feel nothing
For the modest cold suburbia we knowEmbed
