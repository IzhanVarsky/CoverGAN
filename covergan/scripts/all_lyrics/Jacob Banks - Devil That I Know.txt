Devil That I Know Lyrics
We came forward, runnin' backwards
No one man's a island, shotgun ridin' for ya
Somehow we made it, although jaded
Was it worth it all? Could it be more?

Overdosin', at least I'm with my baby
We can't get any higher, we can't get past Messiah
But we're still chasin' for that feeling
Was it worth it all? Could it be more?
And, oh, what a way to die
Standin' eye to eye
Pretendin' we're alive as we grow colder
And, oh, the devil that I know is better than the devil that I don't

So we came forward, runnin' backwards
No one man's a island, shotgun ridin' for ya
Somеhow we made it, although jaded
Was it worth it all? Could it bе more?3Embed
