Make It Out Lyrics
Wake up
Morning coffee cigarette
Watch clouds
Feel the breeze and feel regret

We swim
In
Self-doubt
But I know
We'll
Make it out

Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine

Lazy nights and old cheap wine
About time
We stepped out of death's long line
We swim
In
Self-doubt
But I know
We'll
Make it out

Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fine
Make it out and we'll be fineEmbed
