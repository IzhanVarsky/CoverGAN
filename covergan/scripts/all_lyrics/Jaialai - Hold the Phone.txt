Hold The Phone LyricsSo you came in with me now you’re leaving with them
Is resolve overrated or needed again?
Are you caught up in the middle of the tides?
Are the seas only flowing to your knees?
I know
Cus I know
They can’t see anybody else
Couldn’t see them where they ride
You just caught those feelings and wished them well
I’m saying not tonight
It’s like saying hello to what I’d like
Honey you’ll keep calling me back
Fell off of the map
What the words don’t show when you’re on a lap
They can’t see anybody else
Couldn’t see them where they ride
You just caught those feelings and wished them well
I’m saying not tonight
It’s like saying hello to what I’d like
I won’t be impressed in and out of thought
I won’t be impressed in and out of conscience
So you came in with me now you’re leaving with them
Is resolve overrated or needed again?
Are you caught up in the middle of the tides?
Are the seas only flowing to your knees?
I know
It’s like saying hello
Hold the phone without saying helloEmbed
