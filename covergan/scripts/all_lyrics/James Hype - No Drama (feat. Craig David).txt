No Drama Lyrics
Dancing
To a different tempo
It could just be an echo
I've been reflecting my perspective
And now I know
That love is never simple
No matter high or low
And if it brings you pain then it's okay for you to let go

We don't need no drama, don't need problems in my head
We don't need no drama, dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us one by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama

'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma

Talking
In a different lingo
You told me your heart broke
You've been reflecting, counting blessings
And now you know
That love is never simple
No matter where it goes
And if it brings you pain then it's okay for you to let go
The sun ain't always shining
But trust me, girl, we'll be fine, yeah
Oh, we've all been hurt before, yeah
'Cause love is never simple
We gotta take things slow
And if it brings you pain then it's okay for you to let go
We don't need no drama, don't need problems in my head
We don't need no drama, dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us one by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama

'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma

We don't need
The problems in my head
We don't need
The things we gon' forget
We don't need
A dance with me instead
We don't need

'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-maEmbed
