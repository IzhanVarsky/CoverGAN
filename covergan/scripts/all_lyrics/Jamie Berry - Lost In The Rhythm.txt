Lost In The Rhythm Lyrics
There's a boy downtown from the club I know
He doesn't say a word, just hits the floor
The way he moves always caught my eye
Couldn't take no more, just had to try
I moved to the fours as he danced away
His feet like magic, then he looked my way
And in one swoop, he had my by his side
I knew I was in for a ride, as we-

Swing to the sound
Our feet tap-tappin' and our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and 'round
We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd
That look in his eyes made me sure
We'd be dancing 'til the dawn

Boy, I'll tell ya: that boy can move
Got me twistin' and turnin' around in my Jimmy Choos
Never knew I'd feel so alive
That guy sure knows how to twist and jive
I swayed around the club all night
Not once did he ever leave my side
No matter what, we couldn't stop
Dancing, waiting for that drop as we

Swing to the sound
Our feet tap-tappin' and our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and 'round
We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd
That look in his eyes made me sure
We'd be dancing, dancing, dancing 'til the dawn

We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd

Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
With our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and-
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd

We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
With our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and-
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
(Drop)

Swing to the sound
Our feet tap-tappin' and our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and 'round
We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd
That look in his eyes made me sure
We'd be dancing, dancing, dancing 'til the dawn

Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
With our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and-
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd

We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd

Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
With our heartbeats beatin' and we
Spin 'round and-
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
(Drop)2Embed
