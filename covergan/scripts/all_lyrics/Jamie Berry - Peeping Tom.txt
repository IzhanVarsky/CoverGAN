Peeping Tom Lyrics
There's a Peeping Tom sat outside my window
He's been there for days
And now it's only gone and gotten onto Sunday
And I think it's time to play
'Cause there is nothing more that I like than to be seen
Open up your eyes real wide
'Cause Peeping Tom, I've got a big surprise


So, I slide across my hood, and what do I see?
Sure as hell, the Peeping Tom is looking at me
So, I simply, accidentally, carelessly
Drop my dressing gown for him to see
So, Peeping Tom, keep on looking at me
Peeping Tom tell me
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see, what do- what do you see?

(...and we had to have music... I mean you wouldn't want things to get dreary, would you?
...so, just to keep everybody awake, sort of, I asked a couple of the boys in the band to drop over, too...)

There's a Peeping Tom sat outside my window
He's been there for days
And now it's only gone and gotten onto Sunday
And I think it's time to play
'Cause there is nothing more that I like than to be seen
Open up your eyes real wide
'Cause Peeping Tom I've got a big surprise

So, I slide across my hood, and what do I see?
Sure as hell, the Peeping Tom is looking at me
So, I simply, accidentally, carelessly
Drop my dressing gown for him to see
So, Peeping Tom, keep on looking at me
Peeping Tom tell me
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see? (anything can happen, watch)

Time to play
Peeping Tom tell me—
Time to play
Peeping Tom tell me—
Time to play
Peeping Tom tell me—
Time to play
Peeping Tom tell me—Embed
