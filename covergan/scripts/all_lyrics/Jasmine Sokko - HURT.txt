HURT Lyrics
Yeah, I know how we are
Haven't been doing good for a while
But I just need somebody (need somebody)
So I came to you to cry about
The things that pull me down
But you blame it on insecurities (insecurities)

You see, I know, I know
I know you know my weakness
But you didn't have to rub it in right now to remind me
You said you meant me well with your affection
So I guess there's a glitch in transaction
Some kind of miscalculation

Baby, I am sorry
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just (hurt you back)
I know I'm kind of selfish
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just
I just, I just, I just, I just
Hurt you back
I just, I just, I just, I just
Hurt you back

See I wish I was calm
Spilling words
Like haze getting
Poisons darts right of my chest (right of my chest)
And I like your honesty
But I didn't think I need affection
Of apology, 'cause that is free

You see, I know, I know
I know you know my weakness
But you didn't have to rub it in right now to remind me
You said you meant me well with your affection
So I guess there's glitch in transaction
Some kind of miscalculation

Baby, I am sorry
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just (hurt you back)
I know I'm kind of selfish
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just (hurt you back)
I just, I just, I just, I just
Hurt you back
I just, I just, I just, I just
Hurt you back2Embed
