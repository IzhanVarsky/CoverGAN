Teenage Crime Lyrics
We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime
We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime

We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime
We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime
