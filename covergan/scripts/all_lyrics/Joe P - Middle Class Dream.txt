Middle Class Dream Lyrics
The cold blows through my window
Right through my bones
I bet you don't know what that's like
The sunshine comes through my blinds
Right past my eyes
I bet you don't know what that's like
In the movie, you're the love scene where the camera shows you nothing
I'm just a fly on the wall and I see it all

Find shelter, take cover from me
We're living a middle-class dream

I'm the suburbs, she's the city where you're living
God I wish I know what that's like
And he's the champagne and your headache that you can't shake
God I wish I know what that's like
But if you let me, I could blend into the background every weekend
I'd be a fly on the wall
Safe from it all

Find shelter, take cover from me
We're living a middle-class dream
And don't you wonder why it never rains anymore?
You stay dry all year
And don't you wonder how this doesn't hurt like before?

Find shelter, take cover from me
We're stuck in our middle-class dream

In the backseat of your fresh car
I'm her first time, I bet he won't know what that's like
Where the streetlights never light up that's where we'd come, I bet he won't know what that's likeEmbed
