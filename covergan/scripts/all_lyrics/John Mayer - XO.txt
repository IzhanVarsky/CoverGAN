XO Lyrics
Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Mhh baby, kiss me, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out

Oh, we don't have forever
Baby, daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out, oh
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing
Oh, baby, take me, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out
In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out

I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me girl XO
You love me like XO
Is all that I see
Giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

Oh, in the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out6Embed
