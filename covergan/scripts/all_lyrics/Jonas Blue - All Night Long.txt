All Night Long Lyrics
Sleepwalking
Catch a feeling, carry on
Slow down, yeah
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
Free falling
Keep believing, carry on, on, on, on
'Cause I'll be with you all night long

I, know that I love it when we're high
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
I, know that I love it when we're high
'Cause I'll be with you all night long

'Cause I'll be with you all night long
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
'Cause I'll be with you all night long

Sleepwalking
Catch a feeling, carry on
Slow down, yeah
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
Free falling
Keep believing, carry on, on, on, on
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
I, know that I love it when we're high
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
I, know that I love it when we're high
'Cause I'll be with you all night long

Lately I been thinking 'bout the way you looked at me
Look at me
Even though we're strangers in the dark, you're all I need
And I won't leave

'Cause I'll be with you all night long
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
'Cause I'll be with you all night long

'Cause I'll be with you all night longEmbed
