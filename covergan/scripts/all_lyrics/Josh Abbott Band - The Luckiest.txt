The Luckiest Lyrics
Did I find a field of four-leaf clovers
Somewhere along the way in another life?
Did I meet a genie in a bottle?
Did I make the same wish all three times?
'Cause I don't know what I did
For all my stars to line up like this

I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
And I'm lucky I got friends that got my back
I'm lucky God made Friday nights and cold beer
And that I've had all the good times that I've had
And I'm lucky King George still makes country records
And I'm lucky for the miles on my boots
I can't believe the life that I've been given
Yeah, I'm lucky, I know it's true
But I feel the luckiest to be loved by you

I swear, sometimes, it feels just like I'm dreaming
And if I am, please don't wake me up
'Cause now that I've kissed your lips goodnight
I don't wanna know what it's like
To be without your so good kind of love
I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
And I'm lucky I got friends that got my back
I'm lucky God made Friday nights and cold beer
And that I've had all the good times that I've had
I'm lucky King George still makes country records
And I'm lucky for the miles on my boots
I can't believe the life that I've been given
Yeah, I'm lucky, and I know it's true
But I feel the luckiest to be loved by you

And I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
And I'm lucky for the miles on my boots
I can't believe the life that I've been given
Yeah, I'm lucky (I'm lucky), and I know it's true
But I feel the luckiest to be loved by you
I feel the luckiest to be loved by you (Ooh)
Loved by you (I'm the luckiest)
Loved by youEmbed
