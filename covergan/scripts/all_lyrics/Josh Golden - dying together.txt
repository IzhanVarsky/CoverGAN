​dying together Lyrics
I've tried so many times, I just can't get enough
Damn these bipolar hearts always feelin' too much
Leave you 'til I forget how bad you fucked me up
I've tried too many times, too many times, yeah

Somethin' 'bout you, I'm a addict
Hate you, I need you, we're so problematic, yeah

They say that time makes it better
But shit, it's taking forever
We fall in love like the summer
And change our minds like the weather
You come over just to break up
Then wake up wearing my sweater
But if this love's gonna kill us
At least we're dying together
At least we're dying together
At least we're dying together
(Verse 2)
Up, down, I'm so insane from what you've put me through
Oh well, I think you made me crazier than you
I-I-I-I got no control, I roll the dice and risk it all
I-I-I-I got not control, I'd rather die than let you go
Somethin' 'bout you, I'm a addict
Hate you, I need you, we're so problematic, yeah

They say that time makes it better
But shit, it's taking forever
We fall in love like the summer
And change our minds like the weather
You come over just to break up
Then wake up wearing my sweater
But if this love's gonna kill us
At least we're dying together
At least we're dying together
At least we're dying together
At least we’re dying together
At least we’re dying together

I-I-I-I got no control, I roll the dice and risk it all
I-I-I-I got no control, I'd rather die than let you (Go)Embed
