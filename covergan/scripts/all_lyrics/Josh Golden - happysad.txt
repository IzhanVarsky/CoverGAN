​happysad Lyrics
Summertime, every night we would break up
Most times you would cry out your make up
Make love, still drunk when we wake up
Lost a lot of friends just to keep ya
Never left the house, we was always stuck
My parents hated ya more than all the drugs (Yeah)
Keeping up with you, it was toxic (Yeah)
Still bad that we stopped it

I'm happy, I’m happy, happiest when I'm sad
I'm happy, I’m happy, happiest when I'm sad

I've been sober for a minute now
And I don't like the way it feels
I miss us living on your couch
Getting high off your sister's pills
The stupid shit we fight about
The secrets I still never tell
I'm on a stairway to Heaven
Missing the way you give me hell

I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I’m sad
I’m happy, I'm happy, happiest when I’m sad (Yeah)
I like you most in the madness (Yeah)
It ain't real if it's average, yeah
It's only good when it’s tragic
Maybe we were cursed, maybe we were magic
I heard you moved home, hope you're doing better
So you found a nice guy? Hate to see you settle (Yeah)
'Cause I know how much you love
To cry out your name

I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad

I've been sober for a minute now
And I don't like the way it feels
I miss us living on your couch
Getting high off your sister's pills
The stupid shit we fight about
The secrets I still never tell
I'm on a stairway to Heaven
Missing the way you give me hell

I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad1Embed
