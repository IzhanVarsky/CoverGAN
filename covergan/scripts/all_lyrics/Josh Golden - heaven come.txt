â€‹heaven come Lyrics
Double up the dose, let's go for a ride
That's my fucking girl, we them crazy types
Waste away the days, burn away the nights
Found our broken hearts, lost our fucking minds

Pedal to the floor and I got no brakes (Brakes)
Smoke it 'til it's gone, nothing goes to waste (Waste)
Had 'em high hopes, now I'm losin' my faith (Faith, yeah)
My faith (Yeah), but baby

'Til heaven come, it's you and me
Mixin' things, we shouldn't be
'Til heaven come, don't you fall asleep
Do or die, you and I, we'll try everything
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til heaven come
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til heaven come

Push me to the edge, I know what you like
Empty fantasies, yeah, feed your appetite
Psychadelic love, dancing through the night
You're my favorite drug, you're my favorite high
Head up to the floor and I got no brakes (Brakes)
Smoke it 'til it's gone, nothing goes to waste (Waste)
Had 'em high hopes, now I'm losin' my faith (Faith, yeah)
My faith (Yeah), but baby

'Til heaven come, it's you and me
Mixin' things, we shouldn't be
'Til heaven come, don't you fall asleep
Do or die, you and I, we'll try everything
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til heaven come
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til heaven come

Double up the dose (Double up the dose)
Let's go for a ride

Oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
'Til heaven comes
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til heaven come1Embed
