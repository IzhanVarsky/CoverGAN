â€‹honest Lyrics
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest

Damn it, girl, it hurts my pride (Uh)
Thinkin' that I'm gonna text you
That you're gonna read it and not reply
Staying in every night (Uh)
'Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna see you
Fake another smile and just wonder why
We had to jump to assumptions
Bottle up our emotions
I should've tried to change your mind

I keep lying to myself that it's better this way
I keep lying to your friends, saying I'm doing great
All this time without you got me stuck in lying games
But it's useless 'cause the truth is

That I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
Your love is all that I wanted
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I don't know how I can stop it
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I miss the drunken nights with you (Yeah)
I hope that you still remember
How we danced to Tiny Dancer all around your room
Never knew what I could lose (Uh)
Until I spent a month without you
I hate not being around you, what did we prove?
We had to jump to assumptions
Bottle up our emotions
I should've tried to change your mind

I keep lying to myself that it's better this way
I keep lying to your friends, saying I'm doing great
All this time without you got me stuck in lying games
But it's useless 'cause the truth is

That I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
Your love is all that I wanted
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I don't know how I can stop it
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I'm scared that you don't miss me
After all this time, you still don't miss me
I'm scared that you don't miss me
After all this time, you still don't miss me

I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
Your love is all that I wanted
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I loved you, I loved you, honest
I don't know how I can stop it
I loved you, I loved you, honest

I loved you, I loved you, honest3Embed
