Heaven Knows LyricsPatience, please have patience
Give me just a little more time
Patience, please have patience
Heaven knows how hard I'm trying
I don't know how to do this
I have been so long alone
I can't feel those storm clouds roll in
I ain't got those kind of bones
So patience, please have patience
Can you give me just a little more time
Patience, please have patience
Heaven knows how hard I'm trying
You and I been strangers
Haven't seen you in the longest time
Can I tell you how I'm feeling
Or have you already read my mind?
So patience, please have patience
Can you give me just a little more time
Patience, please have patience
Heaven knows how hard I'm trying
Heaven knows how hard I'm tryingEmbed
