Losing Battles LyricsLost man singing for his soul
I saw it on Rio Bravo
He held the notes like rock 'n roll
And told his tale to Colorado
I gave up my only twin
I turned my face to the world of shadows
Sometimes the righteous win
Most times, it’s a losing battle
Swam naked in the mythic lake
Spent the night on the face of the earth
From the apple tree, I ripped a snake
It was poison but I knew of its worth
I kept it in a box of wood
Fed it on my sins and apples
Tried to do the things I should
Till then, it's a losing battle
It's always been in my nature to be the beast
Blame the maker but stay with me
Drifted down to Tennessee
Lost my heart to a girl of silver
She was trying to be free
There was nothing to forgive her
By the time the fever broke
I’d had enough of trouble
That's when trouble spoke
Sometimes, it's a losing battle
It's always been in my nature to be the beast
Blame the maker but stay with me
Fell into a den of thieves
Got lost in the caves of virtue
Born again into lost belief
Without a friend till the day I met you
Now I'm trying to mend my ways
I had enough of pain and bad will
Good enough for you someday
Till then, it's a losing battleEmbed
