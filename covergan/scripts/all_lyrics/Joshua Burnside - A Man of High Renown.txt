A Man of High Renown LyricsWhere the goats are on patrol
At the bottom of the hill
Where I held you underneath
My burnt and bony knees
Older in the doorway
I was a man of high renown
Bury me here under the sweet grass
That sticks to your thighs
Cover me in elephant oil
All round the dark said
To see your eyes all black
The rush all down your back
The dusty garage floor
Along your soft skin torn
Younger in the roses
You were a man of noble esteem
I'll bury you here
Under the sun beams
That kiss all your limbs
Cover you in petrol and tires
All round the light said
When the muddy rockets flew
And the sisters I had too
Before the towers fell
I dreamt we were in hell
Older in the roses
I was a man of noble esteem
I'll bury you here under the sweet grass
That sticks to your thighs
Cover me in elephant
All round the dark saidEmbed
