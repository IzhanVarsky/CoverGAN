The Only Thing I Fear LyricsOh, when I was younger
And my parents were out working
Hear voices in the attic
Faces in the TV static
Tigers in the garden
Ghosts under the stairs and
Under my bed
Behind the curtain
Always feel a presence lurking
Now that I am older
The only thing I fear is myself
Yeah, the voices in the attic were mine
Well, I don't know what I did last night
I don't know what I said
To make you run a mile from me
There's thunder in my head
Oh, when the day is dying
I take my potion
And float above that endless ocean
But careful friend, this useful tonic
Will boil the blood inside your stomach
And the only thing I fear is myself
Yeah, the voices in the attic were mine
Yeah, the only thing I fear is myself
Well, I just can't find
Peace in my soul
No, I just can't find it
Well, this persistent illusion
That everything is moving
Forward as the weather vane
It spins, spins, spins
And the only thing I fear is myself
Yeah, the voices in the attic were mine
Yeah, the only thing I fear is myselfEmbed
