Behind The Light Lyrics
There is more here than meets the eye
There is something here to behold
Crimson sunsets and violet skies
Mixed with amber and waves of gold

As the light fell underneath the dark
And the whole time, I wondered where you are

I remember the sweeter days
Oh, the summers that never end
Diving headlong below the waves
As they break, the horizon bends

But I still don't seem to understand
Now it's over
So, here I go again


But, alone is harder than I thought
Oh, giving more than I've got
More than I have got
Well, there is something I can't explain
Something burning behind the light
No, it's not that I spoke in vain
Just my words never came out right

In my heart, I, I know I've played the fool
But it was alright when I was playin' it for youEmbed
