Beautiful Anyway Lyrics
You told me the other day
You hate yourself and anxiety
Depressed, a mess to death
You'd open up and open wide with a smile
They told you it's clinical, but I seem so critical
I wish I could convince the thoughts
That you keep on believing were a lie

There you go
Feeling so broken and alone
You walk with your head held so low
You wanna give in
Most the days and that's okay
I hope you see someday that you are beautiful anyway

You look in the mirror
Please try to see it clearer
How crazy and amazing you are and then let it inside
You can be scientific
Trust me, know I get it
But I won't agree when you tell me you don't deserve a life

There you go
Feeling so broken and alone
You walk with your head held so low
You wanna give in
Most the days and that's okay
I hope you see someday that you are beautiful anyway
Raise your hands
Take a second and breathe in
Singin' I'm here for a reason
Raise your hands
Take a second and breathe in
Singin' hallelujah, I'm known and loved
Singin' hallelujah, I'm known and loved
Singin' hallelujah, I'm known and loved
Raise your hands
Take a second and breathe in
Singin' I'm here for a reason

And away you fly
Free with your head held so high
'Cause you never let up the fight
And you never gave in on those days
In the pain

That's what makes this life so wonderfully awesome
And horribly awful
Yet somehow, it's beautiful anyway7Embed
