Blackout Lyrics
This is how we do it
This is how we do it now
Look where it started
Wrap it up, seal it up
Throw it out the window now

We had it all, but
It came to show
You were too caught up
In your ego
It's how we do it
This is how we do it now

Gonna switch you off
Out of my head and thoughts
I've had enough now
Won't take this anymore
I need a, I need a, I need a
Blackout


Blackout
This is how I want it
This is how we do it, now
I know you know it
Wrap it up, seal it up
Throw it out the window now
There's so much talking, but I don't care
Already lost me, I'm outta here
It's how I want it
This is how I want it, now

Gonna switch you off
Out of my head and thoughts
I've had enough now
Won't take this anymore
I need a, I need a, I need a
Blackout


Blackout
Blackout
(Right out of my head)
(Pack up, move on, forget)
Blackout
(Right out of my head)
(Pack up, move on, forget)
Right out of my head
Pack up, move on, forget
Right out of my head
I need a, I need a, I need a
Blackout

Blackout
Blackout
(Erase and rewind, out of my mind
Get out of my mind, yeah)
Blackout
(I'll leave it behind, out of my mind
Get out of my mind, yeah)1Embed
