Galactica Lyrics
Stuck in the screen forever
Reading from the window by my bed
Inside, I've been to nowhere
I'm alright but all my friends are dead
What's the bigger lie?
Way out
Way out

In my world
I'm swallowed by the moon, yeah
The days are always numbered
But it goes on and on and on

Behind the eyes, I see them
Drifting on a parallel to mine
I won't betray the system
Just to show the scars that're on the spine
Now to pull the knife
Way out
Way out
In my world
I'm swallowed by the moon, yeah
The days are always numbered
But it goes on and on and onEmbed
