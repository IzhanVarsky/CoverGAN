Isnâ€™t It Lovely (To Be Alone) Lyrics
One... Two...

Fuck up the party, let it all go
Smash all the windows, tear up the floor
But god only knows what I feel isn't real
After all, All I know is I wanna' go home

Lock up the island and swim from the shore
Pray that the violence stays at the door
But troubles in bed, with the dark
And the hair that you pulled from its head
You know
I wanna' go home
I wanna' go home

Night is old the day is behind us
Talking strangers faded in darkness
And I can't bare one more day in the office
Cause' I know I wanna go home

She's far in the eyes and it's starting to show
I don't seem to know my face anymore
She said why don't you know how I feel?
Honestly
How the hell should I know?
(mmm) I wanna go home
I wanna go
Night is old the day is behind us
Talking strangers faded in darkness
And I can't handle the weight on my shoulders
Cause' I know I wanna go home
And isn't it lovely to be alone?
Isn't it lovely to be alone?
Isn't it lovely to be alone?
Isn't it lovely to be alone?
Isn't it lovely to be alone?
Isn't it lovely to be alone?

Leave the island as it is
It will blow your mind
Leave the island as it isEmbed
