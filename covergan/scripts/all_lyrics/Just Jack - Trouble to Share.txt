Trouble to Share Lyrics
I've been here on my Jack Jones
Steady waiting by the bat phone
I'm getting lost in the red tones (Yeah)
Another world in my headphones (Yeah)
I keep thinking of the old you
And everything I could have told you
It never seemed to be the right time
Now it's forgotten like a cold brew

And I'm getting worried about you
Because I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth
About everything that's going on with you anyway

Call me up if you're feeling low
I'm not going nowhere
You got trouble to share
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind
I'm never going nowhere (I'm not going nowhere)
I got nothing but time

So many people trying to kill time
I can't believe it's not dead yet
Are you filling in a crossword, or are you whittling a chess set
How you dealing with the distance (Distance)
Or are you hiding from the neighbours (Neighbours)
Only another ghost in a ghost town
Twenty-eight days later (Ooh)
And I'm getting worried about you
Because I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth
About everything that's going on with you anyway

Call me up (Call me up) if you're feeling low (Yeah)
I'm not going nowhere (If you're feeling)
You got trouble to share (Low)
Call me up (Call me up), give me a piece of your mind
I'm never going nowhere (I'm not going)
I got nothing but time (Nowhere)

And I'm getting worried about you
'Cause I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth (Call me up)
About everything that's going on with you anyway

Call me up (If you're feeling low) if you're feeling low
I'm not going nowhere (Call me up)
You got trouble to share
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind (I'm not going nowhere)
I'm never going nowhere (Going nowhere)
I got nothing but time
Call me up if you're feeling low
I'm not going nowhere
You got trouble to share
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind
I'm never going nowhere
I got nothing but timeEmbed
