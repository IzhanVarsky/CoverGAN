Winning LyricsMoon like a silver medallion swinging
Riding on a snow white stallion singing
Of everything I’ve ever done or seen
Everything I’ve ever done or seen
Room like an old black 45 spinning
Ain’t it good to know you’re alive and winning
Even if you’re basically alone
Even if you find yourself alone
Just walking around with a white moustache
In a friend of a friend’s house
Hardly a hint of the aftermath
Don’t ever wipe that smile off your mouth
Fell in love with it in summer
Feeling like the night was day
Fools are staying for the winter
Trying to keep the wolves at bay
Suger-coated shell with the heartbreak filling
Buying what we sell we can all make a killing
Money never knows where it’s been
Money never knows it’s history
Room like a star-spangled galaxy spinning
Ain’t it good to know you’re alive and willing
Even if you’re basically a clone
Even if you find that you’re a clone
Just walking around with a white moustache
In a friend of a friend’s house
Hardly a hint of the aftermath
Don’t ever wipe that smile off your mouth
Fell in love with it in summer
Feeling like the night was day
Fools are staying for the winter
Trying to keep the wolves at bayEmbed
