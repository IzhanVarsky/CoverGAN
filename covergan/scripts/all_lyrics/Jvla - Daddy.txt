Daddy LyricsHoe, haha
I know you're a baddie
Squeeze-in your belly
Now you'd do anything, for me
Fendi, gucci and dior
You'll beg me for it
One touch and you'll forfeit
Night you'll never forget
(baby, turn me on)
Turn your daddy on, burn the way you want
You ruined many of them, I'm just one too many
Yes, fold it, hoe, girl I want it all
Diablo in love, god I love that body
On and on and on, on and on it, yeah
All these hundreds, hundred thousand heartbeats
Ah, honey, Hani, ah, hadi, hard it up
Body rarri, yeah, a couple thousand on it
Coke on gucci, sort on gucci
Spilled a thousand on my motherfucking new jeans
Zara, claro
Yo necesito malo
Mami soy el diablo
Te quiero, mi pecado
(Bitch)
All the good shit on me
Aye, just walk, own the shit
I'm addicted to your pussy
Damn, I'll blow up, owned a two-seat (coupe)
Lil shawty way too hot
I just let her play on top
Baby I ain't got no plot
I'm just trynna fuck you, mami
Turn your daddy on, burn the way you want
You ruined many of them, I'm just one too many
Yes, fold it, hoe, girl I want it all
Diablo in love, god I love that body
On and on and on, on and on it, yeah
All these hundreds, hundred thousand heartbeats
Ah, honey, Hani, ah, hadi, hard it up
Body rarri, yeah, a couple thousand on itEmbed
