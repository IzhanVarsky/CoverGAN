Baby Lyrics
Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"

When I walk into the room, you know who I'm looking for
I've been looking for you since I walked through the door like every time before
I could say you're my dream come true, but there's so much I don't like about you
Maybe attraction only counts for a fraction, but it pulls me through

Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
You say you believe in joy and I say I believe in you
You say you've made up your mind and I should make my up mind too
You like to get high, I like to be by your side
You call it a trip, I call it a ride
Sunshine for miles

Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares, she said it all out of despair
I said "It's so you know I care"

I could say you're my dream come true, but there's so much I don't like about you
Maybe attraction only counts for a fraction, but it pulls me through
You like to get high, I like to be by your side
You call it a trip, I call it a ride
Sunshine for miles

Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
Baby, when I have you
I don't need nobody else
She said nothing compares
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"Embed
