Echoes Lyrics
Echo, echo, echo, echo...

Ocean eyes, clear blue sky
I see the signs, but they are sticking through the silence
Don't let go
Don't let go
I still hear the echoes
When I open up the window
The rain keeps me indoor
Can't predict which way the wind blows

You should stay
I should leave
I guess we're never meant to be
Guilt-free
You should stay
I should leave
I guess we're never meant to be
Guilt-free

I got enemies
They got no friend in me
Show them one more time
Prove to those with spite
That I can bring tears
To their eyes
'Cause I'm no saint
But she's in pain
Told me 'bout her life
Wrong she did at the time
That how she missed being in this arms
(Echo, echo, echo, echo)
Oh wait, oh wait
Read me my rights
I can hear the echoes when I sleep at night
Oh wait, oh wait
Read me my rights
I can hear the echoes when I sleep at night

You should stay
I should leave
I guess we're never meant to be
Guilt-free, guilt-free

'Cause baby I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
'Cause baby I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty...1Embed
