Forever Alone Lyrics
No one can say I didn't try
Tried everything to make you feel what I feel
Well, I guess I pushed too hard
And now you're slipping away

Feels like my love for you
Is stopping you from being you
You shine best without me
Like all the ones I had before
I am forever alone

Home alone eating sushi for two
Home alone and I'm waiting for someone who never shows up!
And I'm lonely, I'm angry, I'm tired
You're only giving me drips of your love
Appointments, you've been breaking 'em all
It's like a never ending story
I give, and you take, and I give

Feels like my love for you
Is stopping you from being you
You shine best without me
Like all the ones I had before
I am forever alone
When I held your hand you were sincere
But did you ever think about me when I wasn't near you?
Why would you ever put me first?
You are second to none
I wanted to leave
I tried to find someone new
But I always end up still wanting you
Why do I do this to myself?

Feels like my love for you
Is stopping you from being you
You shine best without me
Like all the ones I had before
I am forever alone

When I'm with you, you tell me you love me
When you're not I don't even exist
If I ask you if you want to hang with me
You got a thousand excuses rehearsed
But when you're drunk and got no place to hide
Who's the one you always call?

Feels like my love for you
Is stopping you from being you
You shine best without me
Like all the ones I had before
I am forever alone
My love for you
Is stopping you from being you
You shine best without me
Like all the ones I had before
I am forever alone2Embed
