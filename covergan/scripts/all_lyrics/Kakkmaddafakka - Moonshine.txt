Moonshine Lyrics
I am serious
Baby, you make me delirious
I wanna be something funny
On your mind

I swear you make me high
I don't care if all is a lie
I can come along, for a ride

And it's Moonshine
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
So you don't play around
Moonshine
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
So you don't play around

Somebody should warm me
About the places you take me
Into the wild side of my mind
I got not her
I'm blue eyes
And it comes as no surprise
I've been around the block
More than twice
And it's Moonshine
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
So you don't play around
Moonshine
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
So you don't play around

Swing around...
Swing around... around, around...
Swing around... around, around...
Fire, oh
Higher, for every turn
Fire, oh
Fire, oh
Higher for every turn
Fire, oh oh oh

And it's Moonshine
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
So you don't play around
Moonshine
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
So you don't play around

Fire, fire, burn, burn
Higher, higher, burn burn
Fire, fire, burn, burn
Fire, fire, burn, burn
Fire, fire, burn, burn
Higher, higher, burn burn
Fire, fire, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burnEmbed
