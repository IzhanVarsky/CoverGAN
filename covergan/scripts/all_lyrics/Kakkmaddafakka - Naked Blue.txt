Naked Blue Lyrics
There's a climate change
You look at me differently today
Down at the local bar
Music plays from the local star's guitar
You say you're leaving this place
Adventure into space
I say don't go too far
You tell me you're a wandering star

My best friends told me I should stay out of trouble
But I'm with you and you're ordering a double

And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
Naked in the blue
Me and you and only water
Swimming naked with you

My life has been a snowstorm
And you look nice and warm
I'm cold and freezing
Navigation isn't easy
Since we were fifteen you've been hanging around
Joked around through ups and downs
And me, I guess I never revealed my intention
But tonight I can't help giving you all my attention
My best friends told me I should stay out of trouble
But I'm with you and you're ordering a double

And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
Naked in the blue
Me and you and only water
Swimming naked with you

And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
Naked in the blue
Me and you and only water
Swimming naked with you

My best friends told me I should stay out of trouble
But I'm with you and you're ordering a double

And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
Naked in the blue
Me and you and only water
Swimming naked with you
And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
Naked in the blue
Me and you and only water
Swimming naked with youEmbed
