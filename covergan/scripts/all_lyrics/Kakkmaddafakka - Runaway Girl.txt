Runaway Girl Lyrics
Guilty love
But we’re halfway around the world
Runaway girl, run away girl
Runaway girl, run away girl

Marathon woman. They can’t catch you
Room 237 in your hotel
You made me promise that I won’t tell
Marathon woman
The rumor say you got one
The rumor say you took someone from another one
Stole someone from another woman

Guilty love
But we’re halfway around the world
Runaway girl run away girl
Runaway girl run away girl
Guilty love
But we’re halfway around the world
Runaway girl run away girl
Runaway girl

I can see it in your eyes
You need another story
You need it for your art
Another broken heart
Another glass of wine
Say have we crossed the border
You say you walk the line
When I f*** you from behind
Hiding conversations in the backseat
Arranging secret meetings in the bathroom
Looking out the window there is a full moon, full moon
Hey baby there is a full moon
Hiding conversations in the backseat
Arranging secret meetings in the bathroom
Looking out the window there is a full moon, full moon
Hey baby there is a full moon, full moon

Guilty love
But we’re halfway around the world
Runaway girl run away girl
Runaway girl run away girl
Guilty love
But we’re halfway around the world
Runaway girl run away girl
Runaway girl run away girl2Embed
