Bipolar Rhapsody LyricsDo you remember those days?
They were oh so funny
When I could call you my babe
I could call you my honey
Well, you held my hand
And you took my money
But you don’t wanna be saved
You just wanna be lucky
We lived miles apart
But waves kept coming
And I held you in my arms
When the tears came running
Well, you held my hand
As you took it all from me
But we don’t wanna be saved
We just wanna be lucky
(wanna be lucky, wanna be lucky)
‘Cos she’s a rich little girl
And she’s oh so lucky
With a pocket full of dynamite
She better keep runnin’
Have you got a reason to be sad
When your daddy’s got money?
Yeah she’s a rich little girl
And she’s oh so lucky
Oh right now
I think I can feel my legs shake
And make the fucking hell right now
Think I can feel my legs shake
What do you wanna get away from now
What d’you wanna get away from?
Make the fucking hell right now
Make the fucking hell shape
Go on, make the fucking hell
I guess that, I’m only real in my head
(ooooh)
(mmmm)
Don’t take me away from this feeling now
Think I can feel my legs shake
(kid brunswick)
Think I can feel my legs shake
I used to drive down to you
When that addy was the topic
We’re just young, numb and broke
That’s why I need these narcotics
I’m brand new baby
What the fuck you want?
Yeah
Brand new baby, born at 21
‘Cos she’s a rich little girl
And she’s oh so lucky
I was hoping I’d
I was hoping I’d find myself
I was hoping I’d
I was hoping I’d find myself
I was hoping I’d
I was hoping I’d
I was hoping I’d
Hoping I’d
Fuck, Off
I was hoping I’d find myself;
She's oh, so, lucky2Embed
