Reminds Me Lyrics
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

I'm stuck, fucked-up, fuck love
I'm up, can't sleep, can't think because
My heart is broke, you left me cold
You left the pain, you took my soul, damn

But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger, man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I can die
Maybe if it was all over, I can have you in another life

I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
Cut off my bitches, won't return no calls, yeah
If I woulda listened, we would still be on, yeah
One of my exes came to break me off, yeah
I mean, yeah, I fucked, but I ain't nut at all, no
Whole time you were on my mind, baby (Baby)
I swear you got me fuckin' love-crazy (Crazy)
Remember when I said nothing phase me (Phase me)
Well, that was 'til I lost my baby, yeah

But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger, man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I can die
Maybe if it was all over, I can have you in another life

(Reminds me of you)
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
