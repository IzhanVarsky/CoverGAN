Follow Lyrics
High in the sky and I feel like I got wings again
Down with the vibes and you know I got you
Alone for the ride and I'm bumpin' with the beat, yeah
Down with the vibes and you know I got you

Let's turn the lights down, oh-oh
Way down, way down
Can't keep my eyes off you
Stay around, stay around

If you lead, I'ma follow
Follow you, follow you, follow you (Oh, tell)
Stay with me 'til tomorrow
It's all on you, follow you, follow you
Somewhere we could
Do whatever we want to, I would
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you

Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If the money get low, low, low
Doing everything close, close, close
Yeah, there's just one thing I need the most
Give me all that body, I need you close, close

Let's turn the lights down, oh-oh
Way down, way down
Can't keep my eyes off you
Stay around, stay around

If you lead, I'ma follow
Follow you, follow you, follow you (Oh, tell)
Stay with me 'til tomorrow
I follow you, follow you, follow you

Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you

Somewhere we go
Do whatever we want to, I would
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you

Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow youEmbed
