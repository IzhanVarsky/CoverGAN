Distant Restart Lyrics
It's time to say what we feel now
End what you say doesn't sit right
Why would we care to idealize
Stay where is less than ideal

And we can try to fake
And we will stay the same
Don't leave me now it's late
You lied you tried to change

I just can't stay where you want me to
Leave everything that I always knew
Did nothing but it still hurts today
I need to know you are not perfect

And there's more to say
I've changed
And we will stay the same
Don't lеave now it's dead
You lied you triеd to changeEmbed
