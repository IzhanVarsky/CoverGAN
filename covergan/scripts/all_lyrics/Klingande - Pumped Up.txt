Pumped Up Lyrics
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

I know a story about a boy
About a boy I used to know
It's kind of funny, you'd never guess
As he smokes a cigarette

I wished that
I could've shown this kid the road
Follow the lines
Instead of doing this alone
And he was singing

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Faster than my bullet
I saw his face from behind the door
A look so pure, I could've sworn
It's not so funny, it's just a mess
Another cowboy in distress

I wished that
I could've shown this kid the road
Follow the lines
Instead of doing this alone
And he was singing

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet4Embed
