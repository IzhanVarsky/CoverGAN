Bolide Lyrics
Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
So close to leave the mine, so close to leave the mine

Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
You notice it divine, you notice it divine

Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to mind

Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
Hold tight

Hold me right
All night, all night
Hold you right
Alright, alright
Hold me right
All night, all night
Hold you right
Alright, alright

Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to mind

Hold tight, hold tight
Hold me right, me right, me right
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
Hold me right, me right
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to mind

Hold tight, hold tight
Hold me right, me right, me right
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Bolide, bolide
Hold me right, me right
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to hold
Hold me right
All night, all night
Hold you right
Alright, alright

Hold me right
All night, all night
Hold you right
Alright, alright

Careful what we wanted and wanted (Hold)
Tend to walk upon it, upon it (Hold you right, alright, all night)
Careful what we wanted and wanted (Hold you right, alright)
Tend to walk upon it, upon it (Hold me)2Embed
