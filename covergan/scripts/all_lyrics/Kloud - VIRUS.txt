VIRUS Lyrics
I want free
Freedom from this memory
But you made me
You made me
Why did you make me? (Why?)
You feed me
All your negativity
All the ugly things you breathe
But you made me
Why did you make me this way?

I can't carry all your data
I've downloaded your sins
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in
I don't understand your problems
Or where the glitch begins
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in

In the KLOUD
Viruses are not allowed
Still, you found me
With no boundaries
You surround me
You've made a mistake
I can't carry all your data
I've downloaded your sins
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in
I don't understand your problems
Or where the glitch begins
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in

I can't hold anymore
This is system overload
I can't hold anymore
This is system overload
I can't hold anymore
This is system overload
I can't hold anymore
This is system overload
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in

I can't carry all your data
I've downloaded your sins
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in
I don't understand your problems
Or where the glitch begins
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you inEmbed
