English Morning LyricsVerse 1
This English morning
This English dawning
That I’m up against
This English yearning
This constant burning
Yet I’m on the fence
I’m always changing
Rearranging to another man
This ceaseless scheming
This breathless screaming
But do I take a stand
No
Chorus
And when your back’s
Against the wall
Well, endless screaming’s
The only thing
That makes sense at all
Verse 2
These shifting feelings
This hingeless reeling
Written on my face
This wingless yearning
This stifled burning
For another place
My madman’s raving his
Stark mad wailings
At my brand new man
The past is calling
The engine’s stalling
But do I take a stand
No
Chorus
And when your back’s
Against the wall
Well, endless screaming’s
The only thing
That makes sense at all
Bridge
And when your backs against the wall
I couldn’t save anything
Is there anything above
Is there anything but love
Chorus
And when your back’s
Against the wall
Well, endless screaming’s
The only thing
That makes sense at all
Outro
Is there a pattern to understand
Is there a lantern to hold in hand
Is there a ladder to climb aboveEmbed
