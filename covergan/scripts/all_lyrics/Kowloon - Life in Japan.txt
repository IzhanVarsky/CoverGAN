Life in Japan LyricsI pour my sake
Down the drain
Can't stand the thought of
Throwing up again
I feel my heart
Pound like the rain
Thinking “this could nothing or
This could be something”
Train car is lurching
Across the bay
The faces in the seats
Don’t ever change
Steetlights speed by
Like the days
Thinking “the world I come from
Is lost beneath the waves”
Life in Japan
Can we make it
Life in japan
Its what we wanted to be
Life in Japan
Can we shake it
Life in Japan
Ain’t what I thought it would be
Speakers blared out
First call to prayer
I marched to work
Through crowds in Thatcher Squarе
I saw you there in the crush
And just starеd
Thinking this could be nothing or
This could be something
Is your heart beating
Or pretend
And does it even matter
In the end
Your smile’s got the
The perfect bend
And your eyes are sparkling
Behind the latest lens
Life in Japan
Can we make it
Life in japan
Its what we wanted to be
Life in Japan
Can we shake it
Life in Japan
Ain't what I thought it would be
Arithmetic has gone backwards
Nothing adds up at all
Drifting though a town I know
And recognize nothing at all
This could be
All that I know
Is behind us
All that I know
All that I know
All that I know
Life in Japan
Can we make it
Life in japan
Its what we wanted to be
Life in Japan
Can we shake it
Life in Japan
Ain’t what I thought it would be
Can we make it
Its what we wanted to be
Can we shake it
Ain’t what I thought it would be
I’m homeEmbed
