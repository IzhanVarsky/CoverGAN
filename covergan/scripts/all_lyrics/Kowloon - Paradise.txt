Paradise LyricsThere's so much life in the ocean
Even life underground
We've a right to some happiness
When it's found
I'm not strong like I used to be
I'm often wrong
I'm often scared that you'll be gone
When you can see
That I'm not what I claim to be
I'm not anything that's good
This could be Paradise
This could be Paradise
There's so much life in the ocean
Living life without sound
Imagine life without music
To be found
If I was scared when you called to me
Right from the start
There was darkness in the sky and in my heart
But if the earth is pulled apart
I'm still yours for good
This could be Paradise
Yes this could be Paradise
It's just a moment
This life ain't never ending
The pages keep on turning themselves
The daylight turns to darkness
The darkness turns to nothing
And nothing turns in on itself
This could be Paradise
Yes this could be Paradise
Paradise
This could be Paradise
There's so much life in the ocean
Living life without sound
Imagine life without music
To be found
It's just a moment
This life ain't never ending
The pages keep on turning themselves
The daylight turns to darkness
The darkness turns to nothing
And nothing turns in on itself
Round and round
And round and round and
Round and round
And round and round and
Round and round
And round and round and
Round and round
And round and round andEmbed
