Monster Lyrics
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

Monster, monster, monster, monster
Mon-mon-mon-mon-mon-monster
Gabry Ponte

Monster, how should I feel?
Monster, how should I feel?

Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through, to, to, to
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, monster, monster, monster
Mon-mon-mon-mon-mon-monster

Monster, how should I feel?
Monster, how should I feel?1Embed
