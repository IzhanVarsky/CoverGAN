GSG LyricsSometimes when I close my eyes I see
A coconut mountain
Sometimes when I open my eyes I see
A coconut mountain (right, alright, alright, yeah, alright, alright)
Used to try to be the nice guy
Live the right life
Things can be so penetrating when you’re constantly waiting for something to happen
Like something significant
Same scenes playing over and over before me
'Cause all I really see are circles before me
'Cause all I really see are black holes before me
'Cause all I really see are mad men and palm trees
Shy guy Shy guy
That’s the name homie Oddi gave to me
IG Twitter Facebook Tinder wave at me
Two years coming now I’m older
97 tatted on my shoulder
Loner
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
I got lotus by my side
And I’m bopping to this dream
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
I see lotus running wild
Through the coconut trees
Sometimes when I close my eyes I see
A coconut mountain (ay)
Sometimes when I open my eyes I see
A coconut mountain
Skid wimp soul kid in green
Fashionably early to the party
Checking out the scene
Looking for some loving
Opportunity yearning
Humoring them big folks thick folks sick folks
It’s the freak show king show biz show
Apocalyptic season (yeah, yeah, you know me)
Being charged of pleasing (yeah, you know me)
Wake up in the morning and I think of you
Wondering if you ever think about me too
This house is cold when I need you most
But I never liked to talk about this before
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
I got lotus by my side
And I’m bopping to this dream
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
I see lotus running wild
Through the coconut trees
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
I got lotus by my side
And I’m bopping to this dream
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
I see lotus running wild
Through the coconut treesEmbed
