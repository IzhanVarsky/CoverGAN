All About You Lyrics
That's really all I'm turnin' like
I'm on your vocal like, "Alright right here, alright right here"
Hahaha

I met you in Atlanta
Sweet like purple Fanta
You know I'm a fan of you, baby

But you like (Girl)
Messin' with my pride
Oh yeah

It's all about you
It ain't about me (Oh no)
I got feelings too (Yeah, yeah)
That you clearly can't see (Go and talk to 'em for a minute, hmm)

I met her in New Orleans
Instantly you got me fallin'
And you know I'd do a crime for you, baby
Oh woah, oh
But you like (Oh)
Breakin' down my pride (Oh yeah)

It's all about you (Yeah)
It ain't about me (Ain't about me, baby)
I got feelings too
That you clearly can't see (Oh yeah)
It's all about you (Oh-ooh)
It ain't about me (Oh, oh, honey)
I got feelings too (Too)
That you clearly can't see (No babe)

I'm in my head
I think I'm goin', crazy
Give you my all
You do me wrong, baby
I'm just gon' say it
I think it's there, baby (Hmm)

But you like
Messin' with my pride
(Ooh, ooh)
It's all about you
It ain't about me (Ain't about me, baby)
I got feelings too (Oh, oh, ooh)
That you clearly can't see (Yeah)
It's all about you (It's all about you, baby)
It ain't about me (Ain't about me)
If the lovin' ain't true
Then we should let it be2Embed
