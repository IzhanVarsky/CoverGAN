â€‹let me die Lyrics
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like

I've got so much shit to say
Baby take me from this place
I just really can not stay
Tears are falling down my face
I feel colder every day
Now they want me out their way
I'll be gone I'll be okay
I just need some fucking space
I walk by I feel them hate
Wanna die 'cause I relate
Wanna cry I feel insane
I get high but can't escape
Would they love me If I change?
Am I lost? Am I too late?
Soon I'm dead I cannot wait
Please don't love me it's a waste
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like

Wanna die so fucking bad
You're the best I've ever had
Wanna die when I look back
Cause you always made me sad
Can't get over shit I'm done
I just make another song
Nothing helps I'm fucking numb
I'll be gone bitch pass the blunt
I've been hurting for so long
Baby kill me in your thoughts
I've been dying all along
Let me go where I belong
Get me drunk bitch, get me high
Give me pills and let me vibe
When it's time just let me die
I'm so tired of this life56Embed
