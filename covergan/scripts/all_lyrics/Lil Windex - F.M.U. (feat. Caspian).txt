F.M.U. Lyrics
Lil Windex baby, best rapper alive
(Lil fucking Windex)

Ay, ay, ay
Woo, woo, woo
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Woo, woo, woo
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Woo, woo, woo
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up

I'm off the bean and the xanny, I'm blowin' trees in the caddy
Ay, ay
I heard there's a party tonight, somebody just tweeted the atty
Yeah
Grab my bitch and I'm gone, you know how much shit we be on
We high on the lot, man I just popped me a perc and I'm feeling like I am on top
That's cause I am, every night I'm goin' ham, I just do not give a damn, neither a fuck
Sometimes I just stare at my bitch to admire the size of her butt
Ughh, damn
Grab me the bottle and pass me the blunt, hand me that blow cause I'm having to fuck
My boys are 100, that snap and they jump get you stuffed in the back of an actavis truck
I don't sleep, I party every night I've been up for a whole week
I gave my bitch X and I notice she gon' freak, so I took her to the bedroom to fuck on some gold sheets
Ughh jeez
I am the shit, my outfit just cost me the price of ya' whip
You talkin' that ish and you might just get hit
Pull up wit' gorillas and light up your crib
Woo, woo, woo
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Woo, woo, woo
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Woo, woo, woo
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up

Pull up in that Rari' I'm flexing with holsters up under the engine
(vroom vroom)
She said, can you get me some drugs, I'm like bitch that's a dumb fucking question, swang (swang, swang)
Still hitting my quota, still taking calls on my flip Motorola
Still doing shit that I probably shouldn't, like fucking your bitch when you thought that I wouldn't
Uh, (Uh Uh)
Red dot up on the AR, one shot I put a body in a grave yard (bang)
All these rap niggas talkin' like they play hard, till the flash got em' lookin' like Ray Charles
She just took a bump of that Tony Montana, I got me a plug on the coast of Havana
Your friends lookin' good tell em' pose for the camera, she just popped a molly she going bananas
Aw, man
Look at my life it got me thinking like god damn
Every day is a fucking party, I'm doing what yall can't
All these people go retarded the minute my squad lands
(Woo) Gang
Remember the name, and mention the boss when you mention in slang
I got me some yungins' They ready and trained and when ever I say so they set up and aim (bang)
Woo, woo, woo
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Woo, woo, woo
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Woo, woo, woo
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Woo, woo, woo
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up5Embed
