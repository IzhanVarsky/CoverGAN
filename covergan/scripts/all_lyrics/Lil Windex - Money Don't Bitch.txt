Money Don’t Bitch Lyrics
Yeah, brr

She's suckin' my dick every time that I step in the room
She must want that iPhone 11 then, hmm
I'll think about it, yeah
She said that it's cool if I go bang her friends
As long as she's drivin' the Mercedes Benz
I guess, yeah aight, let's do it
I got a bad habit, I am an addict
"But what you addicted to?" Buying new pateks
And my life a movie, yo' shit is average
Glock got a dick, shit will do damage
Throw on a scope, blow off your nose
I walk in the room and she throw off her clothes
Bitch, I'm a dog, you know how it goes
Versace the sheets, it's to go with the robe
Woah, woah, gettin' the blankets
She in love with my dick, she said it's her favorite

She want me to wife her, I said to be patient
I mean, you good, but you ain't amazin'
It's money I'm chasin', it ain't a hoe
Cause guess what? (Hmm) Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though
Ayy, ayy, yeah
She want me to wife her, I said to be patient
I mean, you good, but you ain't amazin'
It's money I'm chasin', it ain't a hoe
Cause guess what? (Hmm) Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though
If I'm pullin' up, I better cum
Fucks, no, I don't give none
Forest Gump better run-run-run
Cause I'm goin' dumb-dumb-dumb
Bitch, I'm the boss, you answer to me
I'm throwin' it back when I'm on that D
I'm loadin' a clip, watch what you see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
My bitches is bad, they drink Hennessy
Don't fuck with no opps, you're rich from the street
I slide on that dick like I ride on the bat
Now she's catchin' Z's cause I rocked her to sleep
Bad bitch, little bad bitch fucked it up like a savage
Married to the game, like a horse with a carriage
Ice me out, nigga, in some carrots
Bank account ballin' like a Maverick, ha (Mariahlynn)

She want me to wife her, I said to be patient
I mean, you good, but you ain't amazin' ($teve!)
It's money I'm chasin', it ain't a hoe (Huh?)
Cause guess what? (Hmm) Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though

Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though
 ran through, I'ma kick that door
Man, I got dogs, got pitbull, though
Fill 'em with lead, I'm a pencil, bro
Bitch, I do magic, do this like a pro
I might be poppin', but I got the dope
Ran off with the packs, spent that on a coat
Shoutout to my niggas, I'm givin' them hope
Shorty wanna know my real name
Cause she know how I switch lanes
Girl on my cat like my jeans
Bitch on my arm, like my veins
Thirty on my waste, like some Hanes
See the red dot? It's a Christmas light
Your friend didn't fuck, but your main bitch might
I'm in her dream, like some crystal light
Carry that strap cause my pistol light
She want me to wife her, I said to be patient
I mean, you good, but you ain't amazin'
It's money I'm chasin', it ain't a hoe
Cause guess what? (Hmm) Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though

Bitch do, thoughEmbed
