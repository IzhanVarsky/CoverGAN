Dirt Cheap Lyrics
We drive down the wrong street on the right day
I don't have cold feet but it’s hard to read you, babe
Are we turning left? And are we feeling right?
Can we take the next step? Too many red lights

Was it too rude to just allude?
Picture us nude on Sunday afternoons
Was it too rude to just allude?
Scrabble in my room (Hahaha!)

Oh, I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
I love you whole, you’re like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold

With you, I feel the difference when you are away
You wanna roll a spliff but it's the middle of the day
And is there a time limit on how long I get to keep ya?
Oh, I know I'm a beast, but you're the perfect creature
Was it too rude to just allude?
Picture us nude on Sunday afternoons
Is it too rude? Just picture us nude
Happy with a view (Hehe-oh!)

Oh, I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
I love you whole, you’re like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold

My love’s dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap
My love’s dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap (The sweeter the love)
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap (The sweeter the love)
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
My love, my love, my love is dirt (The sweeter the love)3Embed
