Robbery Lyrics
Another weekend, a new story
I found a diamond in the darkest mine
We started speakin', a-small talkin'
A-tiptoe over the borderline

She left her lipstick on my cheek
I turned around, she vanished in a blink
She hauntin' me and I can barely sleep
I'm lookin' for⁠— Wait, that's her, stop that girl

Hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart and then took off on me
I said hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I put up wanted signs
I said hey, there's been a robbery
I guess I'll never, I'll never know

I've got a fever, a cold sweatin'
It's hard to make it through the day today
Empty-handed, right where you left me
A-ciggies fillin' up the ashtray
Still got her lipstick on my cheek
I turned around, she vanished in a blink
She hauntin' me and I can barely sleep
I'm lookin' for⁠— Wait, that's her, stop that girl

Hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart and then took off on me
I said hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I put up wanted signs
I said hey, there's been a robbery
I guess I'll never, yeah, I'll never know

She got her lipstick on my cheek
She vanished in a blink
And I can barely sleep
Mm, yeah
She got her lipstick on my cheek
I turned around, she vanished in a blink
She hauntin' me and I can barely sleep
Yeah, wait, that's her, stop that girl, hahaha
Hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart and then took off on me
I said hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I put up wanted signs, hey
Hey, there's been a robbery
I guess I'll never, hey, I'll never know

Hey, I'll never know
Hey, I'll never know
Hey, I'll never know
Mm, I'll never know3Embed
