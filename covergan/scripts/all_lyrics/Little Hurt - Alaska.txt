Alaska Lyrics
Yelling at the the loser in the mirror sayin'
"Dude, don’t take it personal"
It’s gonna be another weird month I guess
According to my horoscope
At some Chinese restaurant in San Francisco
My fortune told me I’m on the wrong road
Well life's a game, yeah I need the cheat codes

And I hate the snow, but

I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
Grab all of my money, guitar, and a jacket
Drivin' out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
Last couple of months kinda been a disaster
Tell all of my friends I'm asleep if they ask ya'
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
Sorry I had to move to Alaska

Posting all these pictures on the internet
I want someone to give a shit
Eating ice cream in my bed
I guess the problem is that I don’t even give a shit
Yeah I could bring the vibe down from ten to zero
I'm the world's most pointless superhero
Just me, myself, and my stupid ego
And I hate the snow, but

I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
Grab all of my money, guitar, and a jacket
Driving out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
Last couple of months kinda been a disaster
Tell all of my friends I'm asleep if they ask ya'
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
Sorry I had to move to Alaska

Yeah maybe I just don’t know what I've got
Look at my life like a bad before-shot
Stuck in myself with all the doors locked
When I just want to go

I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
Grab all of my money, guitar, and a jacket
Driving out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
Last couple of months kinda been a disaster
Tell all of my friends (Tell all of my friends) I'm asleep if they ask ya '(I'm real)
Sorry I had to move to Alaska (Woo!)
(Na-na-na-na-na)
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
Sorry I had to move to AlaskaEmbed
