​walk but in a garden Lyrics
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

The days are driftin' slowly by
I guess I'll be here 'til July
I find it hard to have no answers
But the thought of us can make the time go by

We could walk, but in a garden
We could talk while at the market
Takin' moments of our days to be alone
While we don't have all the answers
We still know what truly matters
Keepin' hope alive despite the darkest storm

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

The days are driftin' slowly by
I guess I'll be here 'til July
I find it hard to have no answers
But the thought of us can make the time go by
Yeah, the thought of us can make the time go by
Yeah, the thought of us can make the time go by2Embed
