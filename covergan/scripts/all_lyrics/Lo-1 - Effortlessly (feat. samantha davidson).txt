Effortlessly (feat. samantha davidson) LyricsCHORUS
You are you lovely
Your style
Got everyone looking as you walk away
And in my head I love
The things
That you effortlessly
Pull off on a day
VERSE 1
There's something about you
When will you finally get the clue
What do i do?
You're such a mystery
Thinking back I guess we don't have history
Can you even try to see?
BRIDGE
And when I wake up
I can't get enough
Of all that you do
And when I try to stop
I can't shut it off
There's nothing that I'd change about you
CHORUS
You are so lovely
Your style
Got everyone looking
As you walk away
And in my head I love
The things
That you effortlessly pull off on a day
VERSE 2
There's something about you
And I can't lie I only tell the truth
Through and through
You're such a mystery
Had you in my grasp but you're too slippery
I'm begging please
RAP
Yeah let's think about it, wish about it drink upon it, link upon it babe. We can talk about it, love around  can find it eh. When we  with an answer jumping on to your confession got me a rushing, crushing, hushing, blushing, , your touch
CHORUS
You are so lovely
Your style
Got everyone looking
As you walk away
And in my head I love
The things
That you effortlessly pull off on a day
