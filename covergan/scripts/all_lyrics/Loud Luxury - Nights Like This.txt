Nights Like This Lyrics
You should know that I live for nights like this
And I feel alive when I fell on your lip
Got me paralyzed with blurry lines
I live for nights like this
You should know that I live for nights like this
And I feel alive when I fell on your lip
Got me paralyzed with blurry lines
I live for nights like this

Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, for nights like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, for nights like this

Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, for nights like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, for nights like this
You should know that I live for nights like this
And I feel alive when I fell on your lip
Got me paralyzed with blurry lines
I live for nights like this
You should know that I live for nights like this
And I feel alive when I fell on your lip
Got me paralyzed with blurry lines
I live for nights like this

Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, for nights like this
Nights like this, like this
Nights like this, for nights like this
Nights like this, like this
Like this, for nights like this
