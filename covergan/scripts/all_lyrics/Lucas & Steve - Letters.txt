Letters Lyrics
Met you by the ocean, near the stand we got our alcohol
Two shots and a beer was just enough to get us drunk (Hey!)
Walking down the shore, falling asleep to endless evening talks
Young and wild and reckless, we were trying to change the world

But do memories ever die?
Do our memories ever die?

I wrote you letters to remember
The summer days, no lonely nights
The time I used to call you mine
Now every cold December
I think about the way you dressed
I wish I took a photograph
But I know these memories never die
Yeah, now I know our memories never die


Dancing to the radio, listening to our favorite songs
Singing along all the lyrics to "All Summer Long" (Hey!)
No responsibilities, just running wild on empty streets
And if you ask me then I say, "It's the best it ever was"
But do memories ever die?
Do our memories ever die?

I wrote you letters to remember
The summer days, no lonely nights
The time I used to call you mine
Now every cold December
I think about the way you dressed
I wish I took a photograph
But I know these memories never die
Yeah, now I know our memories never die


I wrote you letters to remember
The summer days, no lonely nights
The time I used to call you mine
Now every cold December
I think about the day you left
I wish I took a photograph
Now I know these memories never die
Yeah, now I know our memories never dieEmbed
