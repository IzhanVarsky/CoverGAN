The Last Day Lyrics
On the last day of my life
I wonder what I will be like
Will I be blue, held up with glue?
Will I be strong and able?

Will I wake and know right then
My final day had just begun?
I hope you're there, with bed-made hair
And a body I can cradle

And in that morning we’d take a walk
Through every street and every park
I hope it's deep, in autumn time
And the leaves are like fires raging

I think I would love the simple things
Like holding hands and noticing
The way the wind moves in-between
And how I never saw you ageing

The afternoon would come so soon
Would there be time for a movie too?
I hope there's one about true love
About how it hurts sometimes
As it fades to black and the credits roll
I think I’d start to lose control
And all those names flash before my face
Did I thank them all in time?

In early eve, you'd start to grieve
And all your doubts and non-beliefs
Would shatter there
And you'd throw up prayers
To keep me from my curse

But I'd hold you close and you'd pray and pray
Whisper everything was gonna be okay
Our final kiss would bring such bliss
And feel just like our first

On the last night of my life
Think I'd rather be surprised
Now every night when I close my eyes
I hold your hand so tightEmbed
