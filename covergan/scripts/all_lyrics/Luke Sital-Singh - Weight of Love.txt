Weight Of Love Lyrics
She rose from a rose bed
All alone and a little scared
To feel the weight of love
With a box full of all her dreams
Looking for a life, and if anything
To feel the weight of love

Early light across her face
So much time but none to waste
To know the weight of love
She longs to find it, but
It's wild and it's blinding
To hold the weight of love

She lets go
And runs out to the highest place
She knows
Just to feel her heartbeat rise above her life below
She says, "it might take everything I've got
But I refuse to be forgotten like everything I've lost"
Oh oh oh, this is how the future starts, oh oh

I know I'm not old yet
But I know what it feels like
To hold the weight of love
Dark clouds in the mind
Sweet fire on the skyline
Oh, the weight of love
Oh, the weight of love
I let go
Run out to the highest place
I know
Just to feel my heartbeat rise above my life below
Oh it might take everything I've got
But I refuse to be forgotten like everything I've lost
Oh oh oh, this is how the future starts, oh oh
Oh oh oh, we are dust becoming stars, oh ohEmbed
