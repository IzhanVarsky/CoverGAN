Contact Lyrics
Baby, your touch is more than enough
To make me lose my mind
You got me so distracted thinking of you
Honey, all the time
And I need to feel your skin on mine
We are just two of a kind
Feel the beat of my heart
First a look, then a spark from a second

When we make contact boy
It's a chain reaction
It's a physical-chemical interaction
When we combine, feel the satisfaction
Deep inside my soul

When we make contact boy
Feel the heat increase
And my mind's racing
Got me weak in the knees
And the air gets thin
I can barely breathe
When you make contact with me
I can kiss you right there
Nice and slow
We can take our time
Tell me what you want, boy
I'll do anything, make you feel alright
And I need to feel your skin on mine
We are just two of a kind
Feel the beat of my heart
First a look, then a spark from a second

When we make contact boy
It's a chain reaction
It's a physical-chemical interaction
When we combine feel the satisfaction
Deep inside my soul

When we make contact boy
Feel the heat increase
And my mind's racing
Got me weak in the knees
And the air gets thin
I can barely breathe
When you make contact with me
When we make contact
When we make contact boy
When we make contact
When we make contact boy

When we make contact boy
It's a chain reaction
It's a physical-chemical interaction
When we combine feel the satisfaction
Deep inside my soul

When we make contact boy
Feel the heat increase
And my mind's racing
Got me weak in the knees
And the air gets thin
I can barely breathe
When you make contact with me3Embed
