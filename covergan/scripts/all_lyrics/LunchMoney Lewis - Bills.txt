Bills Lyrics
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

All these bills piled up on my desk
They looking like a mountain (Everest)
All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'
There's a full moon out, and my girl just keep on howlin'
Says she gon' leave me if I don't come home with 50 thousand (50 thousand?)

Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Goddamn, oh man, goddamn, oh man

I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills
Woke up and I bumped my head
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
Praying that my card don't get declined

Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Goddamn, oh man, goddamn, oh man

I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got

And my shoes, my shoes
I said my shoes!
Ain't got no soul
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

Yo momma got bills, yo daddy got bills
Yo sister got bills, Yo auntie got bills
(I got bills)
Yo uncle got bills
Everybody got bills, everybody got bills
Euhhh!27Embed
