Feels Like Love Lyrics
Put your hands around my body
Spin me 'round and stop the talking
When you hold me yeah it feels like love
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I know never
When you hold me yeah it feels like love

Put your hands around my body
Spin me 'round and stop the talking
When you hold me yeah it feels like love
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I know never
When you hold me yeah it feels like love

Put your hands around my body
Put your hands around my
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I know
Put your hands around my body
Put your hands around my
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I know
Staying up all night
I wanna see
Someone who  like you
Don't take my energy
Imma get real 
In my company
With somebody who's
Better than you, don't try to talk me
You just kill my vibe
Ain't got time to waste my time
No I can't rewind
You know, you know nothing's better
I'm good on my own, better listen as I go
And take these words to somebody else

Put your hands around my body
Spin me 'round and stop the talking
When you hold me yeah it feels like love
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I know never
When you hold me yeah it feels like love

Put your hands around my body
Put your hands around my
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I know
Put your hands around my body
Put your hands around my
You're the one and I don't wanna
Stop the feeling I knowEmbed
