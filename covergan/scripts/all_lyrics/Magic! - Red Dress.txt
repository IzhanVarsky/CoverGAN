Red Dress Lyrics
She’s tried on everything
Everything little thing inside her closet
And she knows it’s getting late
Knows that I’ve been waiting and I’m starving
Cause we’ve been working overtime
She wants to make a night that we’ll remember
And I’m staring at the time
Thinking it’s alright, put on whatever

But I’ve been on my best behavior
Pacing back and forth
And ten thousand lifetimes later
When she walks through the door, I say...

I said hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
You in that red dress
You in that red dress

It’s hard to concentrate
"Finish up your plate"
She whispers to me
But I’ve got one thing on my mind
As they pour the wine
And it consumes me
But I’ve been on my best behavior
Not to cause a scene
But when we finally get home later
It’s just you and me, and I say

And I said hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
Hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
You in that red dress
You

Hey you with the red dress on
I said hey you with the red dress on

Hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
You in that red dress
You with that red dress on
You with that red dress on5Embed
