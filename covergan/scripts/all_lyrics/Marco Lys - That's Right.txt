That’s Right Lyrics
Now we gonna get down
Now we gonna get down
This beat is non stop

That's, that's, that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
Tha-that's, that's that's, that's right
Tha-that's, tha-that's, tha-that's that's right
That's, that's, that's, that's that's that's (right), that's right
Tha-that's, that's right
That's right, right
That's, that's, that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
Tha-that's, that's that's, that's right
Tha-that's, tha-that's, tha-that's that's right
That's, that's, that's, that's that's that's (right), that's right
Tha-that's, that's right
Tha-that's, that's right, that's right, that's right

And what I got is gotta live inside a hot and I'm smoking a pot, huh
Freakin' in the basement, want more?
Ripping every man, and my man named George
Freak it, that's right, speaking the greek
People know we got the speech and the  like Shakespeare were so clear that we're bulls-eyeing
So supplyin', you tryin'
But you can't beat the best, can't test us all
Yo, we're not likе the rest
Hm, yeah wе not to the cool , fuckin' confessing, no, you don't mess with
This beat is non stop

That's, that's, that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
Tha-that's, that's that's, that's right
Tha-that's, tha-that's, tha-that's that's right
That's, that's, that's, that's that's that's (right), that's right
Tha-that's, that's right
Tha-that's, that's right, that's right, that's right
That's, that's, that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
That's, tha-that's, that's that's that's right
Tha-that's, that's that's, that's right

Now we gonna get down
Now we gonna get down

And what I got is gotta live inside a hot and I'm smoking a pot, huh
Freakin' in the basement, want more?
Ripping every man, and my man named George
Freak it, that's right, speaking the greek
People know we got the speech and the  like Shakespeare were so clear that we're bulls-eyeing
So supplyin', you tryin'
But you can't beat the best, can't test us all
Yo, we're not like the rest
Hm, yeah we not to the cool , fuckin' confessing, no, you don't mess with
This beat is non stop

That's, that's, that's that's right
