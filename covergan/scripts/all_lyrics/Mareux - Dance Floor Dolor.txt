Dance Floor Dolor Lyrics
Saw you in the back
You were with somebody else
Had the look in your eyes that said:
"Don't talk to me"
Then I felt my body, separate
I saw it walk itself to the pit

My eyes roll to meet my lovers
Sulking on the dance floor
Got me in a mood dancing by myself
I choose death, not forgiveness
Sulking on the dance floor
Got me in a mood dancing by myself

Between the tracks I look at you
To see what was lost
Then a song came on, and the pain was gone
I started moving closer

My eyes roll to meet my lovers
Sulking on thе dance floor
Got me in a mood dancing by myself
I choosе death, not forgiveness
Sulking on the dance floor
Got me in a mood dancing by myself1Embed
