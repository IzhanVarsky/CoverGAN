Scorpio Lyrics
Sick of all the talk
Show me who you are
Show me
Show me
Never over you
Time won't heal all wounds
Show me
Show me

Scorpio
Your dance
Im losing my mind
Talk to me
For you
You're all I have

Its all about trusting

All this time apart
Embrace me in your arms
For me
For me
Even if its lost
Tell me that we're not
For me
For meEmbed
