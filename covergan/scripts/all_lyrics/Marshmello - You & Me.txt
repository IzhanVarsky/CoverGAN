You & Me Lyrics
And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me
And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me

Doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own

And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me
And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me
(You and me)
And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me

And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what we could be
You and me
And sometimes we fall in love with people at the wrong time
Sometimes, it's okay, baby (yeah)

Doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own

And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me
And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me
(You and me)
And, baby, just please don't go without me
I'm tired of doing it on my own
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
You and me6Embed
