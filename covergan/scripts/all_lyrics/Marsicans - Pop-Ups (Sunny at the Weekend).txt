Pop-ups (Sunny at the Weekend) Lyrics
I got a secret, wanna hear it?
I've got a way you can go far
A way for us to never a have to quit
So listen up and we can start
After a month you'll sail right through
A clear path through crowded room
I'll make you money, make your dreams come true
That's just the kinda thing I do

And it'll always be sunny at the weekend
You'll always be falling when you ring your friends
Live happy ever after when the world ends
And it'll always be sunny at the weekend

If you wanna live the high life
No sign of wrinkles on your face
Just sign right up and chasing the flashing lights
Be very quick, don't leave a trace

If you wanna buy a speedboat
Then come on down and follow me
I can always find another scape goat
Someone who follows endlessly
And it'll always be sunny at the weekend
You'll always be falling when you ring your friends
Live happy ever after when the world ends
And it'll always be sunny at the weekend

Oh, the ride you had to 
Take the 
If you feel you can't come unstuck
You should wait for it to pile up
And the  at the divings well
Turn to cold, oxidising you
Realise you haven't thrown in a line
When the  simply stands high

I got a secret, wanna hear it?
I've got a way you can go far
A way for us to never a have to quit
So listen up and we can start

And it'll always be sunny at the weekend
You'll always be falling when you ring your friends
Live happy ever after when the world ends
And it'll always be sunny at the weekendEmbed
