Throw Ourselves In Lyrics
She said to you
"Control your heart
And start again"
Well these things happen all the time
She said to you
"Although we'll never ever part
Can we just be friends?"
Well these things happen all the time

Falling in
Love with her
You know
It's hard

We never would have known just how it goes we'll never know what might have been
Til we throw ourselves in
Goes to show that we don't know how things will go until they've been
So we throw ourselves, throw ourselves in

You said to me
"There's only one"
And you think it's her
And I don't want to prove you wrong
But you said to me
"The feelings start to weigh a tonne"
Well in love you're an amateur
I never want to see you wronged

Falling in
Love with her
You know
It's hard

We never would have known just how it goes we'll never know what might have been
Til we throw ourselves in
Goes to show that we don't know how things will go until they've been
So we throw ourselves, throw ourselves in

Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her

We never would have known just how it goes we'll never know what might have been
Til we throw ourselves in
Goes to show that we don't know how things will go until they've been
So we throw ourselves, throw ourselves in

Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Fall in love!
Fall out with her
Love!
Love!1Embed
