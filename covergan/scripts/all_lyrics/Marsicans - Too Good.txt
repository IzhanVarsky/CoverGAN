Too Good Lyrics
I've been asking myself questions
Like: "Are you worth it?"
Tried preparing interjections
It's a shame I'm no wordsmith
You are, are-re-re-re

I shut my ears and face my fears
Because I've started
To slip right under all your wonder
Figure where your heart is
Well, I'm sure

You got me caught in a dream
Stuck in a world where it all seems
Too good, too good to believe
Too good, too good
Too good, too good
You got me caught in a dream
Stuck in a world where it all seems
Too good, too good to believe
Too good, too good
Too good, too good
We're a puzzle in our own way
All the pieces fit
You peeled the stickers off my Rubik's Cube
Sunk my battleship
Well, you've won

You got me caught in a dream
Stuck in a world where it all seems
Too good, too good to believe
Too good, too good
Too good, too good
You got me caught in a dream
Stuck in a world where it all seems
Too good, too good to believe
Too good, too good
Too good, too good

You'll spend an hour trying to get your fairy lights to turn on
But it's worth it
Oh, it's worth it
We spend our lives wishing that our love would long live on
We gotta work for it, we gotta work for it
You got me caught in a dream
Stuck in a world where it all seems
Too good, too good to believe
Too good, too good
Too good, too good
You got me caught in a dream
Stuck in a world where it all seems
Too good, too good to believe
Too good, too good
Too good, too good

Too good, too good
Too good, too good
Too good, too good
Too good, too good1Embed
