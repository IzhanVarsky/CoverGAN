Wake Up Freya Lyrics
Wake up Freya, ah
Wake up Freya, ah

Where do I begin? You'll be confused and cry
And I can't blame you, I know it's hard to make sense of life
You'll be living for dreams until they're fulfilled
In someone else's structure that we're just here to build

So what would I tell you, if I knew it all?
To wake up Freya, you're new to this world
It's calm round here, a family of pearls surround you

I've looked around me and I open your eyes
You'll see things aren't perfect and find that your time will fly
Told to measure success by digits and other menial things
Not what you learn or the people you meet or the joy that you bring

So what would I tell you, if I knew it all?
To wake up Freya, you're new to this world
It's calm round here, a family of pearls surround you
So wake up Freya, a new little girl
You'll move everyone to tears, you'll find its a whirlwind when you're here
And I'd tell you this again if I could
Be shaped by the things that you love
Don't worry about things you couldn't care less for
Just try your best to rise above

Wake up Freya, ah
Wake up Freya, ah
Wake up Freya, ah
Wake up Freya, ah
Wake up Freya, ah
Wake up Freya, ahEmbed
