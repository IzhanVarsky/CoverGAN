Your Eyes Lyrics
Well the years just pass
And everyone I know is growing up and old so fast
Am I the only one who wants to make this feeling last
Does everybody think I'm crazy?
Well the years pass by
And everyone's fallen into all these nine-to-fives
They're changing and they're rearranging all parts of their lives
While all my plans are blurred and hazy

I tried to convince myself
That I am not overwhelmed

I can't (Seem to) get myself together
And I'll regret it (All if)
If things don't look better in your eyes, your eyes
I can't (Seem to) get myself together
And I'll regret it (All if)
If things don't look better in your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes

All my friends
Are running out of time to mess around and play pretend
The paths are chosen, and they're known that they might never end
And soon they'll all be having babies
So if I take the plunge
Try soaking up the scenery hoping I'm a sponge
Notoriously porous, I might get soaked up by the sun
And if I do you'll have to save me
I tried to convince myself
That I am not overwhelmed

I can't (Seem to) get myself together
And I'll regret it (All if)
If things don't look better in your eyes, your eyes
I can't (Seem to) get myself together
And I'll regret it (All if)
If things don't look better in your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes


I can't (Seem to) get myself together
And I'll regret it (All if)
If things don't look better in your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyesEmbed
