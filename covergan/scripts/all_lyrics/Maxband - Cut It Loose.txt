Cut It Loose Lyrics
I found a new tell
A ringing of a different kind
I felt my face fall
I heard the way you sighed
I'll hear the same thing
Until the day I die

Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
You string along all your wasted time
You're holding on, but you don't know why
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose

I saw the same signs
As when you started on your way
I saw you get shy
There's nowhere left for me to stray
I want to feel fine
And I want to leave this place

Cut it loose, cut it loosе, cut it loose
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loosе
You string along all your wasted time
You're holding on, but you don't know why
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
Looking up the way to your old place
Still an hour left 'til I get out
Waited for the last commuter train
Been a while since we had to come down
Looking up the way to your new place
Still a ways to go 'til I come down
Navigate our way through dry terrain
Been a year since we had to get out

Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
You string along all your wasted time
You're holding on, but you don't know why
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose

You string along all your wasted time (Cut it loose)
You're holding on, but you don't know why
Cut it looseEmbed
