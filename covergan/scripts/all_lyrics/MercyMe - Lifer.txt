Lifer Lyrics
And now, ladies and gentlemen

It ain't like
I can just walk away
Like choosing when to breathe
You know it don't work that way
It's hard-wired
Living inside of me
No matter where I go
I know you're gonna be with me

I just can't seem to shake it
Even if I could, yeah
I would not change a thing, yeah
Would not, would not change a thing, yeah
If it's pushing you away, yeah
Or running to you
You still love me the same, yeah
Hallelujah

And as long as my heart is beatin'
And my lungs are breathin'
I'll keep on singin' for you
(Woo hoo hoo)
Even right through the moment
(Right through the moment)
When you call me home, yeah
(You call me home)
I'll still be singin' for you
'Cause that's what lifers do
'Cause that's what lifers do
'Cause that's what lifers do
'Cause that's what lifers do
No, I'm not gonna stop
Whatever might come my way
No matter the high or low
You know it don't change a thing

'Cause it ain't what happens to me
Yeah, that don't define me
It's what I got inside me
What I, what I got inside me
And before I was created
(Before I was created)
You already knew, yeah
Ain't nothing gonna separate us
Hallelujah

And as long as my heart is beatin'
And my lungs are breathin'
I'll keep on singin' for you
(Woo hoo hoo)
Even right through the moment
(Right through the moment)
When you call me home, yeah
(You call me home)
I'll still be singin' for you
'Cause that's what lifers do
'Cause that's what lifers do
'Cause that's what lifers do
'Cause that's what lifers do
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
I'm a lifer for life
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
I'm a lifer for life
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
I'm a lifer
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
I'm a lifer for life
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
I'm a lifer for life
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
I'm a lifer

As long as my heart is beatin'
(My heart is beatin')
And my lungs are breathin'
(My lungs are breathin')
I'll keep on singin' for you
(I'm gonna keep on singin' for you)
(Woo hoo hoo)
Even right through the moment
(Right through the moment)
When you call me home, yeah
Not gonna stop, I'll still be singin' for you
'Cause that's what lifers do
(Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right)
(I'm a lifer for life)
'Cause that's what lifers do
(Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right)
'Cause that's what lifers do
(Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right)
(I'm a lifer for life)
'Cause that's what lifers do
(Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right)
I'm a liferEmbed
