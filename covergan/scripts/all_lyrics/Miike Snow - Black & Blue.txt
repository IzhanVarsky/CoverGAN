Black & Blue Lyrics
How long has it been? shall we get into it again?
Excuse our disgrace, we've had no time to paint the place
The dog is always barking at the mailman

I won't waste your time with my revelation

Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, it's all been in my head
Hey world, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue

My dear, come again, your voice is fading out and in
Out of the laundry bin, I found my innocence again
The dog is always barking at the mailman

Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, it's all been in my head
Hey world, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue

Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, it's all been in my head
Hey world, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blueEmbed
