Move On Lyrics
I wish Tracy Chapman was my friend
She would know exactly what to say
Beginnings always hide themselves in ends
At some point, I will be okay

I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain, I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on

Went to see some shaman in Malay
To hear some things I wanted to hear
Everyone just wants to feel good
Everyone just wants to disappear
Call up girls that live in my hometown
To help fill up the minutes
Lit a match and saged my house down
It didn't make a difference
So I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain, I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on
I know I got to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on5Embed
