Coming Down the Mountain Lyrics
I was up to my elbows
You know the way it gets
I was looking for exits and I had far too many friends
So I packed up my suitcase
I threw away my phone
I told you I loved you, I just had to leave you alone

Then I went walking through the rhododendron flowers
Got me a fishing pole and it’s been ten years now

But I’m coming down the mountain again
Get the word to all my good-time friends
The fishing was fine but fishing comes to an end
I’m coming down the mountain again

I traded my trimmings
For a white cotton robe
I gave up my grudges and paid back all my loans
You fools in your cities
Think you got it made
The yoke of this harlequin world will break you to pieces someday
And you’ll go walking through the rhododendron flowers
Looking for white robes but the prophet won’t be found

I’m coming down the mountain again
Get the word to all my good-time friends
The fishing was fine but fishing comes to an end
I’m coming down the mountain again

Let’s go walking through the rhododendron flowers
Isn’t it lovely above the madding crowd?

I’m coming down the mountain again
Get the word to all my good-time friends
The fishing was fine but fishing comes to an end
I’m coming down the mountain
Coming down the mountain againEmbed
