The Only Way Lyrics
I need you on the phone all alone
The records on
And you say
You want it all the time
It's like sunshine and I feel fine
Then you run away

I can't believe
It's the only way
You're all I need
Then you ran away

It's alright with me I'm fine it's okay
You explained it all to me today then ran away

I need you on the phone all alone
The records on and you say
You want it all the time
It's like sunshine and I feel fine
Then you ran away

I can't believe
It's the only way
You're all I need
Then you ran away
Come this way before you find what is left
You forgot the thing that matters to me most
My mind


(I can't believe)Embed
