​colorblind Lyrics
No, it's...
I can't, I can't really...
I can't really just explain it
It's... I don't know, it's...
Uh, let me try

Slow down
I know you wanna understand
So I'll explain the best I can
What this pain feels like
It's hard
'Cause even as I'm sitting here
I would rather disappear
Than face the world outside

I'm floating in a fallen sky
I'm okay, well, maybe not
(Here it comes again)

So I breathe, am I gonna drown?
You'll be fine, I say it out loud
I should let someone know
Maybe when I'm better
So I breathe, will it ever end?
You'll be fine, I say it again
I should let someone know
That something doesn't feel right (Feel right)
It's like I'm colorblind (It's like I'm colorblind)
'Cause everybody's world's in color
Except for mine
It sucks
'Cause everything's in black and white
And I can't say I'm numb inside
'Cause that just sounds so dark
It's hard
'Cause even as we're sitting here
We're fighting off a constant fear
But no one sees that part

It's like I'm floating in a blacked out sky
You think you're okay, but then you're not
(Here it comes again)

So I breathe, am I gonna drown?
You'll be fine, I say it out loud
I should let someone know
Maybe when I'm better
So I breathe, will it ever end?
You'll be fine, I say it again
I should let someone know
That something doesn't feel right (Feel right)
It's like I'm colorblind (It's like I'm colorblind)
'Cause everybody's world's in color
Except for mine1Embed
