Upside Down Lyrics
Everything is upside down
Oh, yes it is (Yeah)
Everything is upside down
Oh, yes it is
Everything is upside down
Oh, oh, yeah

Every single night I watch the evening news and wonder
If the cards are really stacked, if they're coming from the dealer
If the drinks are truly free, yeah, the odds are in my favor
Someone better go, go, go get the Meyer

Yeah, cut it up, cut it up, it's Friday night
And in my experience, yeah, the timing's right
Yeah, let's cut it up, cut it up, it ain't my fault
It's a love song, girl, come turn it up

Everything is upside down (Oh, yes it is)
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah) (Yeah)

Every single word that is uttered from a tower
On the roofs of Manhattan to the bombs of the summer
In the bars, in the gutters, in the ears of your lover
In the words of a sinner, in the thoughts of your father
Yeah, run it up, run it up, it's Monday night
And in my experience, yeah, the traffic's light
Yeah, let's run it up, run it up, it ain't my tab
It's a love song, man, come breathe it in

Everything is upside down (Oh, yes it is)
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah)
Everything is upside down (Oh, yes it is)
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah) (Yeah)

In the words of a sinner, in the thoughts of your father
Yeah, cut it up, cut it up, it's Friday night
And in my experience, yeah, the timing's right
Yeah, let's cut it up, cut it up, it ain't my fault
It's a love song, girl, come turn it up

(Everything is upside down) Yeah
Everything is upside down
(Everything is upside down, oh)
Everything is upside down
Everything is upside down (Everything is upside down)
Everything is upside down (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Everything is upside down (Everything is upside down)
Everything is upside downEmbed
