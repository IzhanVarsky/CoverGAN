Gravity LyricsLose my weight
When I'm with you, zero g
Float in endorphines
I can't drown
Something's different now
A pull of gravity
My heart grows heavy
And I drown
For the moments we fight
For the moments we tried
For the moments we save
The moments we hesitate
What am I to say
What am I to do
When there's no gravity
Pulling me towards you
You
I won’t drown when you pull me into you
Cut me loose
Pull me in your gravity
This weight feels less heavy
Magnetic fields between you and me
Hold on
This feels like collision course
A tender and violent force
I won’t drown when you pull me into you
To fight
To try
To save
I won’t drown when you pull me into you
To fight
To try
To save
I won’t drown when you pull me into you
Cut me loose
Pull me in your gravity
This weight feels less heavy
Magnetic fields between you and me
Hold on
This feels like collision course
A tender and violent force
I won’t drown when you pull me into you
You
I won’t drown when you pull me into youEmbed
