Invisible Lyrics
Every morning feels like yesterday
Put a smile on your sad face
When you walk at the door
And you can't take no more
Everything bringing you down
And they look at you strange
Like you're a mistake
So you just turn around but sometimes

Don't you wish you were invisible ?
Still be here but hidden to the world
You can be whoever you want
And no one's gonna judge
And you ain't got nothing to prove
Don't you wish you were invisible ?

I been screaming in my loneliness
Trying to find love and happiness
But then you're on your own
And you try to bе strong
But everything bringing you down
And you feel so strange
Likе you're a mistake
So you just turn around but sometimes
Don't you wish you were invisible ?
Still be here but hidden to the world
You can be whoever you want
And no one's gonna judge you
And you ain't got nothing to prove
Don't you wish you were invisible ?


Don't you wish you were invisible ?
Still be here but hidden to the world
You can be whoever you want
And no one's gonna judge you
And you ain't got nothing to prove
Don't you wish you were invisible ? (Don't you wish you were
Invisible ?)Embed
