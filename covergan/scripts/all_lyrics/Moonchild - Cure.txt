Cure Lyrics
I've had my eyes on you
For a while and though
It seems that time isn't right, I know
You want the love that I've got to give
We laughed and kissed
'Till the sun took us by surprise
Telling the whole truth about our lives
I'm so in love with what you've got to give

I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache

You think your heart needs to hurt for a while longer
Live all alone 'till it makes you stronger
Learn who you are without her love
I know, I've been there before
But I won't wait for a love like yours
I can't hesitate, stay a while
And let me change your mind
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
(Won't you let me show you?)
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
(I just wanna love you, don't be afraid)
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache1Embed
