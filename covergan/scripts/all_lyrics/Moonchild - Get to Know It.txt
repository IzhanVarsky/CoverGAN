Get To Know It Lyrics
I’m done runnin ' from it
I’ve spent too much time
I’m gon' get to know it (Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
Keep it by my side

I was waiting out the wonder
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
Won’t let the wait take me under
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I was waiting out the wonder
Won’t let the wait take me under

The answer’s in reflection
I’m rising up
The truth is gonna find me
I’m rising up
The answer’s in reflection
I’m rising up
Know the truth is right behind me
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)

Hands in the air I’m jumping in
(Jumping into the deep end)
It’s a friendly fight (Friendly fight)
Got to, got to, sink into the feeling (Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
Before you can rise
I was waiting out the wonder
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
Won’t let the wait take me under
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I was waiting out the wonder
Won’t let the wait take me under

The answer’s in reflection
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)
The truth is gonna find me
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)
The answer’s in reflection
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)
Know the truth is right behind me
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)

The answer’s in reflection
(Get to know it, get to know it)
(Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
Oh, the truth is gonna find me
(Get to know it, get to know it)
(Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
Ahh, ahh
(Get to know it, get to know it)
(Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
Ahh, ahh
(Get to know it, get to know it)
(Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
I’m gonna learn
Get to know it
ThereEmbed
