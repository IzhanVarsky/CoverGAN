Run Away Lyrics
I'm not gonna

Been tryin' to
Look the other way
Like we never knew, love
Givin' you this space
All i've got to say is stuck
Spinning in my head
I'm done, i'm not gonna pretend

I should have known
It'd be this hard
To let you go
Dream my heart
The little things
Drive me insane
I'm not gonna run away, no-no

I’m not gonna run away from our love
I’m not gonna run away from our love
I’m not gonna run away from our love
I'm not gonna run away, no
Still makes me smile
And i'm not gonna hide it
Learn to love what's left
Cause i'm too tired to fight it
So ready to move on
But not to forgot you baby
You meant somethin' to me
More than somethin'

I should have known
It'd be this hard
To let you go
Dream my heart
The little things
Drive me insane
I'm not gonna run away, no-no

I’m not gonna run away from our love
I’m not gonna run away from our love
I’m not gonna run away from our love
I'm not gonna run away, no

I'm not gonna run away
I'm not gonna run away
I'm not gonna run away
I'm not gonna run away1Embed
