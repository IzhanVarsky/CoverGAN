The Truth LyricsTired but searching for the answers
Tying myself down with all I find
Still purpose circles like a dancer
But in my mind
My spirit is with the breeze
Far from the things I used to know
Wild and free
Using the truth to let go
Serenity rests in me
Far from the things I used to know
I found the strength to let it show
I smile cause I know that it's okay
I've got this love to help me slip away
Far from all the worry that defines you
To live in truth
The truth is in love
In love there's a light
The truth is in love
There's love where it's right
My spirit is with the breeze
Far from the things I used to know
Wild and free
Using the truth to let go
Serenity rests in me
Far from the things I used to know
I found the strength that I found itEmbed
