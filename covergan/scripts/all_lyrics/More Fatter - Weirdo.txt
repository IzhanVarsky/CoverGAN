Weirdo LyricsCaught your eyes in the firelight
Shaking in my bones
Just be cool, act a fool
I go stupid for you
Right and left
They're always asking
Time for me to quit the masking
What to do?
Records broken, jump in motion
I'm not joking
Lemme make it clear to you
(I'm just a weirdo and so are you)
Ohhh
I am a weirdo
(Can't help it)
Ohhh
Just thought I would let you know
(Get with it)
Shake it up
Shake it down, baby
Shake it all around
Still a party if my body's movin' all alone
(All alone, all alone, all alone)
Right and left
They're always asking
Time for me to quit the masking
What to do?
Records broken, jump in motion
I'm not joking
Lemme make it clеar to you
(I'm just a weirdo and so are you)
Ohhh
I am a weirdo
(Can't hеlp it)
Ohhh
Just thought I would let you know
(Get with it)
Ohh
Ohh
Don't you get it
Don't you get it
Don't you get it
(x4)
Ohhh
I am a weirdo
(Can't help it)
Ohhh
Just thought I would let you know
(Get with it)
Ohhh ohh ohh
I am a weirdo
(Can't help it)
Ohhh ohh ohh
Just thought I would let you knowEmbed
