Purple Heart (feat. Drifting Lights) Lyrics

Woke up, had been asleep for days
Find myself in the strangest place (place)
A happily trashed mind, we’re goin’ back to the grind
This world keeps unfolding
It’s taken it’s toll
How could I be so kind?

Though it sounds like somethin’ I’d say
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart
In an effort to keep the conversation
Though it sounds like somethin’ I’d say
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart
In an effort to keep the conversation

I’ve never been so tired (Tired)
I’ve never been so (Oh) tired
I’ve never been so tired (Tired, hey)
(I’ve never been so tired)
And I surrender my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Though it sounds like somethin’ like I’d say
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart
In an effort to keep the conversation (Conversation)
I’m maxed out like my credit card
In the back of a stranger’s car
I can’t remember where I left my mind
I was high at the time

This world keeps unfolding
It’s taken it’s toll
How could I be so blind? (Oh)

Though it sounds like somethin’ like I’d say
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart (Ah)
In an effort to keep the conversation (Ah)
Though it sounds like somethin’ like I’d say
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart
In an effort to keep the conversationEmbed
