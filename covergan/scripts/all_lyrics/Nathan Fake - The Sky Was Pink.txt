The sky was pink LyricsIf you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think of this
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think on this
Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky
If you ever want to lose some time
Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Just take off and think of this
Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky
The sky is glass, the sea is brown
And everyone is upside-down
Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky
Freak out
Freak outEmbed
