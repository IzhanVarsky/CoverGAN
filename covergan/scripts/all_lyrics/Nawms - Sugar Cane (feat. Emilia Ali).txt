Sugar Cane LyricsVerse 1:
If I could put my life into a verse
Then I would turn this car around
Drive to where we first met
And punch you in the mouth
And we could play who's hurting worse
And you can never let me down
Oh, I wanna find all my old fairytales and
And rip the pages out
(Chorus)
Oh if love was so sweet and easy
What's with all this blood stain?
If my gums gon' taste like copper
Least I should get sugar cane
Oh you should bring me candy and go away
Cause if you're gonna leave me bitter
Least I should get sugar cane
You should bring me candy
You should bring me flowers
If you'rе gonna leave me sour
Lеast I should get sugar
Least I should get sugar cane
Verse 2:
Well did you hear about my universe?
Because you kinda blew it up
Wish I could take back every moment that I
Ever gave a fuck
Well I guess it's time I put me first
Cause I still haven't learned how
All I think about is you with her
Cause I got nothing else to do now
(Chorus)
Oh if love was so sweet and easy
What's with all this blood stain?
If my gums gon' taste like copper
Least I should get sugar cane
Oh you should bring me candy and go away
Cause if you're gonna leave me bitter
Least I should get sugar cane
You should bring me candy
You should bring me flowers
If you're gonna leave me sour
Least I should get sugar
Least I should get sugar caneEmbed
