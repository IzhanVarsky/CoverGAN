Nitrous LyricsAnd if you see old nitrous man
Selling laughter from a can
Go tell him that the dream still fits the plan
And that's why we're waiting at the table
Yes he's welcome at the stand
And I won't mind
The moment you can say
That you saw in a dream
How you can let me know anyway
That you've seen the day
No more to pay
Where trouble came and drove
But we drove away
We get we get mad with no words to say
We get mad waiting
Waiting to get paid
And somehow we get mad giving too much away
Oh we get mad giving too much away
We get mad with the load and the leverage of each day
Surely there's time for you and me
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
Surely there's time for you and me
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
I'll wait til the end of time for you
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
Baby I won't lie
I didn't want to say
Until I heard in a dream how I can let you know anyway
That I've seen the day
With no more to pay
When trouble came a drove
But trouble drove away
I see you get mad with no words to say
And you see me waiting
Waiting to get paid
And somehow we get mad giving too much away
We get mad with the load and the leverage of each day
So if you see, oh nitrous man, selling laughter from a can
Tell him that the dream still fits the planEmbed
