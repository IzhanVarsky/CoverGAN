When The Body Is Gone LyricsWhen the body is gone
So long, so long
When the body is gone
Where will I go
Where will you be?
Plunging as a tear into a river of a light divine
For sure
Rising from the sea with a rain cloud
To fall once more
When your life is a song
Sing on, sing on
Because death, death is perfectly safe
Only the truth is the case
Death is perfectly safe
Oh my little seed are you afraid
With the coming of the shade?
Youâ€™re made
Death for you, like slipping off a tight shoe
Is when you can be
Free
Death, death is perfectly safe
Only the truth is the case
Death is perfectly safe
When the body is gone
So long, so longEmbed
