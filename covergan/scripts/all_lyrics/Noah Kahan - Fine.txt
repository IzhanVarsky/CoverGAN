Fine Lyrics
I'm just a sailor swimming backwards
I'm just a fish out in the sea
I'm just a preacher in the graveyard
Telling everyone but God to follow me

I'm just a liar who got lucky
I ain't no different from the rest
I might be jaded and delusional
But at least I found a home inside my head

This is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive

I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine

I miss the permanence of failure
I miss the honesty of pain
But I sever ties with all my anger
So I guess it's just the world we'll have to blame
This is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive

I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
(I'll be just fine)

Point your fingers like a gun
Ain't it sweet to be someone
Take your last breath to mend the fall

'Cause this is for all those lies I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the last damn thing that I hold close to me
I won't let anyone so wrong tell me what's right

And this is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we're, we living in
I won't let anyone so wrong tell me what's right
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive
I won't let anyone tell me that I ain't fineEmbed
