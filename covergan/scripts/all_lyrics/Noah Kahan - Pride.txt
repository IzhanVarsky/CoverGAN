Pride Lyrics
Home alone again, I'm wonderin'
But you cut me off
Don't leave me alone with all my thoughts
I remember when, when you used to say
We could always talk
Even if all we had was lost

Now you won't admit it
Burned the bridge and now you're leading me on
Come on
So save me the trouble
I don't want to suffer, move on
Move on

Honey, you don't have to lie
That you're busy or too tired
You're out every weekend now
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little
Oh no, you don't have to call
'Cause the photos say it all
I see you're letting your hair down
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little every time
You're not in my head, you're under my skin
And in my blood
I don't know why I care so much
I tried to understand what's in your plans
And what you want
'Cause you just keep me hanging on

Now you won't admit it
Burned the bridge and now you're leading me on
Come on
So save me the trouble
I don't want to suffer, move on
Move on

Honey, you don't have to lie (I don't have to lie)
That you're busy or too tired (I'm so tired)
You're out every weekend now
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little
Oh no, you don't have to call (I don't have to call)
'Cause the photos say it all (Say, say, ooh)
I see you're letting your hair down
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little
Honey, you don't have to lie
That you're busy or too tired
You're out every weekend now
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little every time2Embed
