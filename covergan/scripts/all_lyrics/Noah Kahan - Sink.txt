Sink Lyrics
Oh, she hates to say goodbye
So she only says goodnight
When she goes, she stops to look behind
And I'll sink
Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh no, yeah, summer comes and goes
But I'll sink

Oh, she's the sunset in the west
Oh, she is sleep when I need rest
And though the ship can be saved yet
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again

Oh, she promises to write
I know it's harder if she tries
So I have grown to tell myself a lie
And I'll sink
Time slows to let me talk alone
High hopes don't last me very long
Winding roads, they never seem to stop
But I'll sink
Oh, she's the sunset in the west
Oh, she is sleep when I need rest
And though the ship can be saved yet
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, I would never sink again
And oh, I would never sink again
And oh, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again

Oh, she's the path in which I tread
Oh, she's the shiver up my neck
Oh, she's the blood rush to my head
Oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again2Embed
