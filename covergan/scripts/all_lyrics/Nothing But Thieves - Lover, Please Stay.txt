Lover, Please Stay Lyrics
Lover, I know you're weary
Eyes are tired from the night
Lover, come to the kitchen floor
Tiles are cold, so am I

So take from me what you want, what you need
Take from me whatever you want, whatever you need
But lover, please stay with me, oh

Lover, I feel your sorrow pouring out of your skin
And I don't wanna be alone
If I am tonight, I'll always be

So take from me what you want, what you need
Take from me whatever you want, whatever you need
But lover, please stay with me, oh

And I can see you, I can feel you
Slipping through my hands
Oh and I can taste you, I can taste you
Slipping through my hands
So take from me what you want, what you need
Take from me whatever you want, whatever you need
My lover, please stay with me
My lover, please stay with me18Embed
