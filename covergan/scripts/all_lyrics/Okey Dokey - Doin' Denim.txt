Doin’ Denim Lyrics
Look, there's somethin’ up ahead
It's lookin' like it’s years from now
At the watering hole
Ready to keep on the fantasy phone

Wander, wander
Wander through the day
Wander, wander
Wanderin' way back to ‘78
Generally I'm a player
I'm lookin' for a bed right now
El General Jackson, is runnin' on empty
They still recognize me at the bar somehow

We lost all our leather
Now we're doin' denim
Now we’re lookin’ country
Playin' songs for women
Don’t know what I'm doin'
But I know I fit in with them
Oh, I know I fit in with them
Dreams, I haven't had one since 16
Sleep is for the weak
So I drink until the sun don’t rise

Wander, wander
Wander through the night
Wander, wander
Wanderin' way back to '79
Generally I'm a player
I'm lookin' for a bed right now
El General Jackson is runnin' on empty
They still recognize me at the bar somehow

We lost all our leather
Now we're doin' denim
Now we're lookin' country
Playin songs for women
Don't know what I'm doin'
But I know I fit in with them
Oh I know I fit in with them

We lost all our leather
Now we're doin' denim
We lost all our leather
Now we're doin' denim
We lost all our leather
Now we're doin' denim
Now we're lookin country
Playin songs for women
Don't know what I'm doin'
But I know I fit in with them
We lost all our leather
Now we're doin denim
Now we're lookin country
Playin songs for women
Don't know what I'm doin
But I know I fit in with them
Oh I know I fit in with themEmbed
