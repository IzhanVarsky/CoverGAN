Call Me When You Land LyricsWhat am I waking for?
Am I waiting for a sign
That I'm brave enough to follow?
Can I just fail enough to bail out?
I'm in my Wednesday suit
I'm just so sick of this commute
Are they always speakin' to me?
Only advertisers know me
Maybe I'm just fallin' away
Counting down the days
Tryna make a better mistake
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Call you when I land
Don't think about the distance
Do you understand
Not everything is missin'?
Oh, oh
We're gonna figure it out
Call me when you can
Don't think about the future
Maybe lend a hand
'Cause failure is a feature
Oh, oh
We're gonna figure it out
I'm in Belvеdere
You said the air was crystal clеar
I get attached to my surroundings
Like they know everythin' about me
Maybe I'm just fallin' away
Counting down the days
Tryna make a better mistake
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Or maybe I'm just falling apart
How'd we get so far?
Tryna make a better escape
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Call you when I land
Don't think about the distance
Do you understand
Not everything is missin'?
Oh, oh
We're gonna figure it out
Call me when you can
Don't think about the future
Maybe lend a hand
'Cause failure is a feature
Oh, oh
We're gonna figure it out
Call you when I land
Don't think about the distance
Do you understand
Not everything is missin'?
Oh, oh
We're gonna figure it out
Call me when you can
Don't think about the future
Maybe lend a hand
'Cause failure is a feature
Oh, oh
We're gonna figure it out3Embed
