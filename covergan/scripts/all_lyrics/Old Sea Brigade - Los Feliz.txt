Los Feliz LyricsIs the call not enough?
Everything was running smooth
I can't keep up
Pacing in my work shoes
Just terrible luck
The champagne was off
Everything was lit brilliantly
In my place
All is well
Can't you see
Close your eyes
Fall asleep
Take your old
Rosary
Say goodnight
Los feliz
Maybe it's me
'Cause everyone is feeling it
But I don't believe
Something in my memory
Is holding me back
A passive attack
Everything is sat perfectly
In its place
All is well
Can't you see
Close your eyes
Fall asleep
Take your old
Rosary
Say a prayer
Los feliz
I was lost
In the deep
Found a way
Come with mะต
Take your old
Rosary
Say goodbye
