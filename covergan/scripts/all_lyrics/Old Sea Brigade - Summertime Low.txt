Summertime Low LyricsTook it back in time
Take it in your stride
The mother in your mind
Are you saving a life
The tides are comin' in slow
Everything is unknown
Just need you at home
You had every right
I wanna be well but don't wanna try
All I can hear is my daughter cry
The weight of the sun is making me thin
Burning my skin
Wish I could see autumn
The way I've been falling
I wanna be free
Carelessly me
It's summertime low
With everything golden
It's hard to be open
I'm missing your touch
Not alone but enough
To have a summertime low
You know I'll never miss thе smell
Of your obvious tell
Or your shit magic spells
Thе stars do not care
Wish I could see autumn
The way I've been falling
I wanna be free
Carelessly me
It's summertime low
With everything golden
It's hard to be open
I'm missing your touch
Not alone but enough
To have a summertime low
I wanna be well but don't wanna try
All I can hear is my daughter cry
The weight of the sun is making me thin
Burning my skin, wish I could hear
All of the ways you sing in the dark
Brutally honest but always harsh
Weight of the world is breaking my back
Where were you at?
Wish I could see autumn
The way I've been falling
I wanna be free
Carelessly me
It's summertime low
With everything golden
It's hard to be open
I'm missing your touch
Not alone but enough
To have a summertime lowEmbed
