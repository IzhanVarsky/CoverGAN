Everythingâ€™s Gonna Be Alright Lyrics
You know some people never change their minds
(Everything's gonna be alright)
Well either way we're gonna be just fine
(Everything's gonna be alright)
Even when you try to bring me down
(Everything's gonna be alright)
You see, I'm still here, let me adjust my crown
(Everything's gonna be alright)

It will be alright, alright
It will be alright, alright
It will be alright, alright

Two steps forward, ten steps back
(Everything's gonna be alright)
Killing us dead, Black lives don't matter
(Everything's gonna be alright)
I can hear you loud and clear
(Everything's gonna be alright)
It feels like you don't want me here
(Everything's gonna be alright)

Things will be alright
Alright, alright
It gonna be alright, alright
Alright, alrightEmbed
