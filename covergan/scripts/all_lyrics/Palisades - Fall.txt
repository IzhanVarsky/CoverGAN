Fall Lyrics
I wanna fall and never once look back
I wanna know I make you feel like that
I wanna make this the start of something
So can you say that you want it all?

(When you're out there, you just wanna have fun)
Got me paranoid, caught up in the feels
I don't even know if this shit is real
When you're out there, you just wanna have fun
And I don't wanna think that it's you on the run

Tell me what you think about me
We've been up all night for two weeks
I've been staring into these sheets
Wondering if I got what you need

I wanna fall and never once look back
I wanna know I make you feel like that
I wanna make this the start of something
I wanna feel like it's all or nothing now
So can we fall and never once look back?
'Cause baby, I'm not looking for a "ten night stand"
I wanna make this the start of something
So can you say that you want it all?
Got me so drunk on the thought of your touch
But playing with you, baby, just ain't enough
I came for your body, but I stay for the vibe
And I don't wanna think that I'm just a crush

Tell me what you think about me
We've been up all night for two weeks
I've been staring into these sheets
Wondering if I got what you need

I wanna fall and never once look back
I wanna know I make you feel like that
I wanna make this the start of something
I wanna feel like it's all or nothing now
So can we fall and never once look back?
'Cause baby, I'm not looking for a "ten night stand"
I wanna make this the start of something
So can you say that you want it all?

I can feel her body asking me to give her everything
'Cause I know she knows we've got the finest chemistry
She got me sweatin', don't know what the hell is wrong with me
'Cause I know she knows that we can't let it go to waste
'Cause I don't wanna leave it alone with a "ten night stand"
(When you're out there, you just wanna have fun)
Let me try to make you the one, I could be that man, let's go
I wanna fall and never once look back
I wanna know I make you feel like that
I wanna make this the start of something
I wanna feel like it's all or nothing now
So can we fall and never once look back?
'Cause baby, I'm not looking for a "ten night stand"
I wanna make this the start of something
So can you say that you want it all?3Embed
