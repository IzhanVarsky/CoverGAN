Human Performance Lyrics
I know exactly where I was when I
First saw you the way I see you now, through these eyes
Waiting to retry
Those pristine days I recall so fondly
So few are trials when a life isn't lonely
And now if only
I'd never felt it, I'd never heard it
I know I loved you, did I even deserve it
When you returned it?
There's no suspicion, no hesitation
Believing through the eyes of sure adoration

Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Shield like a house closing its doors
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours

Ashtray is crowded, bottle is empty
No music plays and nothing moves without drifting
Into a memory
Busy apartment, no room for grieving
Sink full of dishes and no trouble believing
That you are leaving
Mid-sentence tremors, mind at its weakest
One way of shaking off the thoughts that it sleeps with
Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Shield like a house closing its doors
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours


In walks the darkness, I pitch without you
Asks me do I realize what I'd done and who I'd done to
Indeed I do know
It never leaves me, just visits less often
It isn't gone and I won't feel its grip soften
Without a coffin
Breathing beside me, feeling its warmness
Phantom affection gives a human performance

Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Shield like a house closing its doors
Curved in the dark, rinses of yoursEmbed
