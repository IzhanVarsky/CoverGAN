Wide Awake Lyrics
I'm wide awake
Mind so woke 'cause my brain never pushed the brakes
I'm wide awake
Eyes so open that my vision is as sharp as a blade
I'm wide awake
Movin' and groovin' and I ain't ever losin' the pace
I'm wide awake
Mind so woke 'cause my brain is as sharp as a blade

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

(Anybody sleepy?)

I'm wide awake
Mind so woke 'cause my brain never pushed the brakes
I'm wide awake
Eyes so open that my vision is as sharp as a blade
I'm wide awake
Movin' and groovin' and I ain't ever losin' the pace
I'm wide awake
Mind so woke 'cause my brain never pushed the brakes
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake2Embed
