Breakin’ Point Lyrics
In the European late October night
Stay inside with your doubts
In the quest of what it's worthwhile or just trite
On the couch, hypnotized
It's a small step for humanity, a giant step for me
I've been waiting for your kick to set me free

Saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
Got it from whiskey like any loser can
Been running on empty, I leave it all in your hands
Now show me what to do
I'm listening to you

You've been hiding in the bosom of my dream
Now the clock sets the scene
We've been eagerly awaiting your entrée
What to do? What to say?
All the trivialities are out of focus in my mind
All I really wish is you'll be doing fine

Saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
Got it from whiskey like any loser can
We're running on empty, I leave it all in your hands
Now show me what you do
I'm listening to you

I saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
Got it from whiskey like any loser can
We're running on empty, leave it all in your hands
Now show me what you do
I'm listening
I saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
Got it from whiskey like any loser can
We're running on empty, leave it all in your hands
Now show me what you do
I'm listening to you

Listening to you
Listening to you1Embed
