One for the Team Lyrics
It's a dream, it's a dream
And we're gonna rein it in
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
It's a team, it's a team
I'm the keeper of the scene
But I don't wanna play this part alone

Keep a close watch on the good thing you found
Clear out the cobwebs of the mind
We can rise above, unwise and unkind
Leave all the pettiness behind
And all gold that glitters but it's mine

It's a dream, it's a dream
And we're gonna rein it in
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
It's a team, it's a team
I'm the keeper of the scene
But I don't wanna play this part alone

Decades in, you wake up all in a daze
Yet all of the goals so far away
Time's a thief, a hardened act to defeat
But we're built to last and run the course
This one's for the team, this one is yours
It's a dream, it's a dream
And we're gonna rein it in
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
It's a team, it's a team
I'm the keeper of the scene
But I don't wanna play this part alone
It's a dream, it's a dream
And we're gonna rein it in
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
It's a team, it's a team
I'm the keeper of the scene
But I don't wanna play this part alone
It's a dream, it's a dream
Hey, man, we gonna rein it in
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
It's a team, it's a team
I'm the keeper of the scene
But I don't wanna play this part alone

There's no one coming home tonight
I'm out here on my own tonight
It might be a bumpy ride
But we're still here by your side1Embed
