What You Talking About? Lyrics
You used to be my hero
Now you're just another boss
Though I rate myself as zero
I can't understand what you talking about

All the anger left my body
I'm drying off in the aftermath
Five years as your understudy
When I can't understand what you talking about

I got a message to you
Cause I can't follow through

Tell me lies and I will listen
Tell the truth and I'll be gone
Tell me why I need permission
You don't have to shout
I can't understand what you talking about
No, I can't understand what you talking about

Shining in your shadow
How could I sink this low?
Our acquaintance has been so-so
And I can't understand where my patience gone
Cap in hand, waiting for my saviour
You raise a toast for your setting son
I was on time but you turned up later
Always expecting to end up alone

I got a message to you
Cause I can't follow through

Tell me lies and I will listen
Tell the truth and I'll be gone
Tell me why I need permission
You don't have to shout
I can't understand what you talking about
Tell me lies and I will listen
Tell the truth and I'll be gone
Tell me why I need permission
You don't have to shout
I can't understand what you talking about
No, I can't understand what you talking about

What you talking about?
What you talking about?
What you talking about?
What you talking about?1Embed
