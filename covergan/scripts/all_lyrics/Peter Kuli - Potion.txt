Potion LyricsAll of these voices that are warm inside my bed
You give me pressure like the walls inside my head
I think you should give me faster calling than I'm after
When I'm falling out of love
You keep talking on my ear, dear
I won't fight your demons for you
Get rid of your fear
When you find me swimming across your ocean
Babe I be your potion, when you cry
Take your tears back, I don't need your problems
Until you resolve them, get the fuck out my past
All of these voices that are warm inside my bed
You give me pressure like the walls inside my head
I think you should give me faster calling than I'm after
When I'm falling out of loveEmbed
