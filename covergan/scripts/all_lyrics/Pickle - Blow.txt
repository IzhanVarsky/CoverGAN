Blow Lyrics
Blow my whistle baby
Blow my whistle baby

Blow my whistle baby
I know you're crazy for me
Let’s get freaky baby
I know you want me baby

Blow my whistle baby
Blow my whistle baby

Blow my whistle baby
I know you're crazy for me
Let's get freaky baby
I know you want me baby

Blow my whistle baby
I know you’re crazy for me
Let's get freaky baby
I know you want me baby
Blow my whistle baby
Blow my whistle baby
Blow my whistle baby
Blow my whistle baby

Blow my whistle baby
I know you're crazy for me
Let's get freaky baby
I know you want me baby
Blow my whistle babyEmbed
