Can’t Stop Your Lovin’ LyricsIt feels so real
More than love I've felt before
And I know now there is love
I will try to keep you satisfied
Don't wanna be sad again
With you, this feels like the first time
Why do I always push away
The things that I, I wanna say?
I can't stop when you're with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop, you're playing with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop when you're with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop, you're playing with me
I just can't stop all your loving
Can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving
Oh, can't stop your loving
I just can't stop all your loving
History, keeps ourselves from moving on
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't wanna be lost boys
And never reach the finish line
(Never each the finish line)
Why do I always, push away
The things that I, I wanna say?
And can you believe me when I say
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you?
I can't stop when you're with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop, you're playing with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop when you're with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop, you're playing with me
I just can't stop all your loving
(Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop)
(Can't stop, I just can't stop all your loving)
(Can't stop, I just can't stop all your loving)
Can't stop when you're with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop, you're playing with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop when you're with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop, you're playing with me
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving (I can't stop it)
I can't stop your loving
I just can't stop all your lovingEmbed
