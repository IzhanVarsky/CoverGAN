Just Kids Lyrics
Uh, I've got a feeling
And I wanna let you know
Your energy is speaking
Wind me up and watch me go

I wanna get, wanna get, wanna get
Wanna get inside your love
Your body and your mind
I wanna get, wanna get, wanna get
Wanna get inside your world

Tonight, 'cause it feels like we're just kids
Doing what we do so what if?
I've got my hands all over you
The truth is (uh uh)
This is what kids do
Singing, singing

The devil on my shoulder
Wants to see your soul undressed
The angel on the other
It's telling me to go ahead
Tonight, 'cause it feels like we're just kids
Doing what we do so what if?
I've got my hands all over you
The truth is (tru-u-uth)
This is what kids do
Singing, singing

We're just kids
So what if?
The truth is (uh uh)
This is what kids do
Singing, singing, singing
I've got a feeling, feeling, feeling
I'm feeling
Uh, I've got a feeling
'Cause it's you and me
You and me, babe
You and me
You and me, babe
You and me
You and me, babe
You and me
Oh oh, yeah
We're just kids
Doing what we do so what if?
I've got my hands all over you
The truth is (uh uh)
This is what kids do
Singing, singing1Embed
