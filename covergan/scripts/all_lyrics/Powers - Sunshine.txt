Sunshine Lyrics
I was trying to escape into outerspace on a bottle rocket
Looking for a happy place, little piece of grace
Put it in my pocket, oh
Yeah, I jumped and I flew till I fell where I am
Tried to get away, but I slipped on my hands
You should have seen my face standing at the gates
No one to unlock it, oh yeah

Sunshine is gonna come now
Rain down, all over you
Good times are gonna come now, look 'round
Baby it's true
Sunshine is gonna come now
Rain down, all over you
Good times are gonna come now, look 'round
Baby it's true
Sunshine
Sunshine

Throwing wishes at the street
Following my feet
Looking for a moment
I was blowing with the breeze
Swinging on trapeze
Going through the motions, yeah
Oh but time, ain't got time to be waiting around
She too busy paying money and she ain't slowing down
I'm still cutting all my teeth on a faded dream
Watching it unfolding, yeah oh
Sunshine is gonna come now
Rain down, all over you
Good times are gonna come now, look 'round
Baby it's true
Sunshine

Woah, my my
Sun is gonna shine, gonna shine on through
Woah, my my
Woah, it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you
Woah, my my
Sun is gonna shine, gonna shine on through
Woah, my my
Woah, it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you
Sunshine

Sunshine is gonna come now
Rain down, all over you
Good times are gonna come now, look 'round
Baby its true, oh
Sunshine is gonna come now
Rain now, all over you
Good times are gonna come now, all around
Baby its true

Woah, my my
Sun is gonna shine, gonna shine on through
Woah, my my
Woah it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you4Embed
