Cold Fire Lyrics
I don't remember which train I caught
But someone woke me up two stops short
With no bag, no clue
Walking home in the pouring rain
Tryna tell myself nothing's changed
'Cause I'm alright
These streets don't lie
Can't let the memory fade
Everyday, think I seen your face

So give me that cold fire
During all those years away, oh
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away, oh
'Til the last glass breaks

Up on the mantle, those trophy wives
Making money, not making time
No love, no life
No regrets when I walked away
But they've been creeping back everyday
I'm running blind
Through streets don't lie
Can't let ambition fade
Everyday, think I seen your face
So give me that cold fire
During all those years away, oh
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away, oh
'Til the last glass breaks

Everyday, think I seen you
Like a knife, really cut through
Crackin' ice in a soda
'Til the last glass breaks
Everyday, think I seen you
Like a knife, really cut through
Crackin' ice in a soda


So give me that cold fire
During all those years away, oh
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away, oh
'Til the last glass breaks

Everyday, think I seen you
Like a knife in a cut through
Crackin' ice in a soda
'Til the last glass breaks
Everyday, think I seen you
'Til the last glass breaks3Embed
