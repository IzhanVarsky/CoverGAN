Fake It Lyrics
Four feet behind me, you're talking to somebody new
So close I hear you, I smell your perfume
But I could watch you fall in love a hundred times and still feel nothing
'Cause I don't miss you, I just miss having something

But if you turn around and I drink all this down
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
And I know it's nothing real but for fun I don't need feels
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
Fake it

I know you miss me, you said that you do
Too many chances though, I thought that you knew
That I could watch you fall in love a 100 times and still feel nothing
'Cause I don't miss you, I just miss having something

But if you turn around and I drink all this down
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
And I know it's nothing real but for fun I don't need feels
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
One more night
Maybe faking it isn't making it any easier
Easier on me
(Two, three)

But if you turn around and I drink all this down
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
And I know it's nothing real but for fun I don't need feels
Maybe we can fake it one more night?Embed
