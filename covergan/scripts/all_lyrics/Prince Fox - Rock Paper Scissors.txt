Rock Paper Scissors Lyrics
You wouldn't be sweet if I dipped you in sugar (In sugar)
You know it's best, so why, why are you bitter? (Bitter)

Say it to my face, don't take my name in vain
See, that's what you do
Say it to my face, you know you can't replace me
But I want you to

Rock, paper, scissors
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors
I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors

I cut you off
I cut you off
I cut you off

You could be Aretha but got no respect
Just want a chance? No thank you, next
No, I'm done with you
Crying to me you're always alone
But you bringing trouble when you leave the home
No, I'm done with you
Say it to my face, don't take my name in vain
See, that's what you do
Say it to my face, you know you can't replace me
But I want you to

Rock, paper, scissors
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors
I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors

I cut you off
I cut you off
I cut you off

Rock, paper, scissors
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors
I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors

I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off
I cut you offEmbed
