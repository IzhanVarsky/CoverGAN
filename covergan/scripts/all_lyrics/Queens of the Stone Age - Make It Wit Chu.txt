Make It Wit Chu Lyrics
You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two
And I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin in the end
I ain't here to break it
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That jus' ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon
I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wanna do
Anytime, anywhere, and I say babe
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
(Yeah)
I wanna make it
(Whooo)
I wanna make it wit chu


I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again and again and again and again)16Embed
