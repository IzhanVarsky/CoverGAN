Amazing LyricsHey!
Why do you fan the flame
That makes me melt in this
Rave
I am through
I'm tumbling and stumbling
Yeah
But
Strangely all the things you do to bring me to my
Fall I love
(Amazing)
Too late
To pretend
You know that I'm already in your
Chains
And it happened suddenly
So suddenly, maybe
I’ll
Find my way back to the peace that I
Lost
Lost
Lost
Take it
She's a liar
Hiding in tomorrow
While I’m livin’ in today
Anyway
So Amazing
Amazing
Amazing
Stop!
It's criminal
You want to play and never give a
Fuck
Cause you enjoy my misery
In mystery
And
I just try to understand whether you're my curse
Or my luck
Again
She's a liar
Hiding in tomorrow
While I am in today
Anyway
So Amazing
Amazing
Amazing
Why
The most amazing lady
I havе ever known
Breaks
My hеart in pieces
Cause I am sure
That I have imagined you
Once
Once
Once
Stay
Little liar
Hiding in tomorrow
While I am in today
Anyway
So Amazing
Amazing
