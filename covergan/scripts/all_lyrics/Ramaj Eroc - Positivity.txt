Positivity Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, aye

There's too much negativity on my timeline
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
I wanna follow everybody that follow me
Under one condition
Please be positive
Please by positive
Please post positivity
Please do that for me
For me

Back and fourth we go insulting each other for what?
Argue then makeup
This is what humans do for love
We been through it all
Yeah, it's always been two of us
No, we don't need new friеnds
Can't have no one come scrеw this up
Damn, that's so antisocial
I'm so introvert
But sometimes I may seem so vocal
I done lost my senses
Merry go go round in circles
I know lust is temptin'
This damn explore page got me scroll, scroll, scroll
I be like "woah, whoa"
This algorithm knows me well
Better than my friendS
Girl, I can tell
I sound upset, I know
But ain't nothing set in stone
I see the light when I'm with you
But feel much darkness from this phone
Because
There's too much negativity on my timeline
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
I wanna follow everybody that follow me
Under one condition
Please be positive
Please by positive
Please post positivity
Please do that for me
For me

Look, you get so flattered over likes
Yeah, they matter to you
But the trolls that bestow bad comments
Under photos shatter you
I know it took a good sixty pics
In your camera roll
Before you decided to upload
And still not get the response
Your indecisiveness is owed
Girl, you know how social media goes
They hurtin' too
Voicin' bad opinions
With good hopes you hear them
But all you post is positivity in attempt to steer them
In the best direction
Yeah, I know it makes you tear up
If you ever seek validation
Just look in the mirror
Though you get so upset
Girl, ain't nothing set in stone
I see the light whenever you post
But still feel darkness from my phone
There's too much negativity on my timeline
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
I wanna follow everybody that follow me
Under one condition
Please be positive
Please by positive
Please post positivity
Please do that for me
For meEmbed
