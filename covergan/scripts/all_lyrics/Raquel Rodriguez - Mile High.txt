Mile High Lyrics
I bought us round trip flights to Paris, baby
Cause I wanna go somewhere and only be with you
I need a break from California lately
Somehow the golden state has got me feeling blue

Well, it seems to me my life is passing by
Things come and go
In the blink of an eye
My soul is craving for a little change
I gotta go, I gotta get away
But oh, my baby

I want you to go with me
We can fly
Oh baby, mile high
I want you to go with me
We can fly
And you got me saying
(Ohhhh)

I don't wanna spend another minute waiting
Waiting around for someone else to make my move
But I just get so damn insecure about it
Running around talkin about how I got nothing to prove
But running always makes me feel alone
So far gone, with nowhere to go
But standing here just makes me feel this way
I gotta go now, I gotta get away
But oh, my baby
I want you to go with me
We can fly
Oh baby, mile high
I want you to go with me
We can fly
And you got me saying
(Ohhh)
(Ohhh)Embed
