Gunpowder LyricsIt’s a give and take kind of situation
I know exactly what you want from me
So pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Let’s fire it off tonight, fire it off tonight
We've got the pedal to the floor
We're racing the daylight
We're the only ones here tonight
So let’s light it up
Like no one is watching, no one is watching
I've got that burnin' like a fire
You've got that look in your eye
We're gonna light this fuse
And set it off like there's no tomorrow
Light me up, light me up when you feel the urge baby
The way we're blowin' it up, makes me think just maybe
We'll rock it out till the sun comes up
Cause it's a gunpowder kinda love
Light me up, light me up I'm feelin crazy
It's like a bomb went off, and I think just maybe
Light the candles and we'll talk it up
Cause it's a Gunpowder kinda love
It's not what you think it is
It's so much simpler than this
How do they do it so well
I love that Gunpowder smell
Round two, I find, myself, thinkin' about you
Not a day went by I didn't dream about this night
Let's give it another try
We can count on the red and blue
For breaking my heart, you know exactly how to make me choose
We can always take the long ride home
Put the pedal to the floor, come on let's go
I've got that burnin' like a fire
You've got that look in your eye
We're gonna light this fuse
And set it off like there's no tomorrow
Light me up, light me up when you feel the urge baby
The way we're blowin' it up, makes me think just maybe
We'll rock it out till the sun comes up
Cause it's a gunpowder kinda love
Light me up, light me up I'm feelin crazy
It's like a bomb went off, and I think just maybe
Light the candles and we'll talk it up
Cause it's a Gunpowder kinda love
It's not what you think it is
It's so much simpler than this
How do they do it so well
I love that Gunpowder smell
Give it to me
The Gunpowder makes me feel this way
I've got a sickness that won't go away
The Gunpowder makes me feel this way
Believe the words that I say
Gunpowder
Light me up, light me up when you feel the urge baby
The way we're blowin' it up, makes me think just maybe
We'll rock it out till the sun comes up
Cause it's a gunpowder kinda love
Light me up, light me up I'm feelin crazy
It's like a bomb went off, and I think just maybe
Light the candles and we'll talk it up
Cause it's a Gunpowder kinda love
It's not what you think it is
It's so much simpler than this
How do they do it so well
I love that Gunpowder smellEmbed
