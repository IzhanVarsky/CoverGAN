Turn Me On Lyrics
Doctor Love

Living life all wrong
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
But my heart, it was made of stone
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
But all that glows ain't always gold

And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Doctor Love
Doctor Love
Doctor Love
Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
I can never dim the lights again

And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Doctor Love
Doctor Love
Doctor Love

And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Doctor Love
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love, you know just what I needed)
