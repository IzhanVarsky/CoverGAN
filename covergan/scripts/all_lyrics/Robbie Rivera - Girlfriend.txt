Girlfriend LyricsI'll never runaway
I'll never tell you lies
I'll never cheat on you
I'll never make you cry
Do you wanna be my boyfriend?
Girlfriend
Do you wanna be my boyfriend?
I wanna be your girlfriend
I wanna be your girlfriend
Do you wanna be my boyfriend?
I'll never runaway...
I'll never runaway
I'll never tell you lies
I'll never cheat on you
I'll never make you cry
I wanna be your girlfriend
Do you wanna be mine?
Because I wanna be your girlfriend
Do you wanna be my boyfriend?Embed
