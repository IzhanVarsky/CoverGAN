Maybe This Christmas LyricsMaybe this Christmas will mean something more
Maybe this year love will appear
Deeper than ever before
And maybe forgiveness will ask us to call
Someone we love, someone we've lost
For reasons we can’t quite recall
Maybe this Christmas
Maybe there’ll be an open door
Maybe the star that shone before
Will shine once more, oh
And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
In heavenly peace, grateful at least
For the love we've been shown in the past, oh
Maybe this Christmas, maybe this ChristmasEmbed
