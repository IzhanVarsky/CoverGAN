Feels Like Iâ€™m Home LyricsSmile like a blanket
Laughing wild eyes
Wrapped in a moment
Breathing a life
I finally saw it, waiting for me
Never stop wondering, how I could be
Home, home, home
Feels like I'm home, home, home
It's been too long, long, long
Feels like I'm home, home, how
Feels like I'm home
Somewhere to run to
Nowhere to be
Life in a locket
Turning the key
I finally saw it, waiting for me
Never stop wondering, how I could be
Home, home, home
Feels like I'm home, home, home
It's been too long, long, long
Feels like I'm home, home, how
Feels like I'm home
Oooooo,oooooo,ooooooo
Feels like I'm home, home, home
Feels like I'm home, home, home
It's been too long, long, long
Feels like I'm home, home, home
Feels like I'm homeEmbed
