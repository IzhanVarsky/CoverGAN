Stars Are on Your Side Lyrics
Somewhere past tomorrow is better than it seems
The life you're livin' dreamed
If you're ever broken, there's always an open door
A beacon towards the shore

Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see through the other side
So get up off your knees, hope is still alive
That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find
'Cause the stars are on your side
Yeah, the stars are on your side

If you're holdin' breath, tired and you're frail
Just exhale
Know you're bound for glory
And that all is never lost
No mater the cost

Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see through the other side
So get up off your knees, hope is still alive
That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find
'Cause the stars are on your side
Yeah, the stars are on your side
Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see the other side
So get up off your knees, hope is still alive
That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find
'Cause the stars are on your side
Yeah, the stars are on your side2Embed
