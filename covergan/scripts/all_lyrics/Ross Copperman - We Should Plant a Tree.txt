We Should Plant a Tree LyricsI wanna be with you
I wanna stand with you
I wanna show you that I'll be here
When the seasons change
I wanna reach for you
I wanna bend with you
I wanna shelter you
And you can shelter me the same
And when the wind is cold
And the leaves fall down
We'll wait for spring
To come back around
We should plant a tree
We should carve a heart
We should make some shade
Where the river starts
Watch the storms of life
From a front porch swing
While our dreams grow wild
And our roots run deep
We should plant a tree
I wanna drink the rain
I wanna feel the sun
Be strong and solid to weather
Whatever comes
And when we're just a stone
In a hundred years
I want the world to know
That we were here
We should plant a tree
We should carve a heart
We should make some shade
Where the river starts
Wash the storms of life
From a front porch swing
While our dreams grow wild
And our roots run deep
We should plant a tree
Yeah when the wind is cold
And the leaves fall down
We'll wait for spring
To come back around
We should plant a tree
We should carve a heart
We should make some shade
Where the river starts
Wash the storms of life
From a front porch swing
While our dreams grow wild
And our roots run deep
We should plant a treeEmbed
