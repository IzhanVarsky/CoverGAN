Crying Lyrics
I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, "Hello"

Oh, you wished me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
When you said, "So long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying
Crying, crying

It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying
Crying, crying

Yeah, I'm crying, crying
Over you6Embed
