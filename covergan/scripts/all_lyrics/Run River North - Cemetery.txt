Cemetery LyricsWas it Tuesday in the summer
When you started sleeping on my couch
And I lost track of the details
Of what is and what isn't allowed?
Midnight in the cemetery
This day started ordinary
But now I'm wishing I could slow the whole world down
Is it crazy if we stay here all night long?
Everybody needs a way to hold on
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Hesitating with commitment
Out of fear that we may break the spell
Good intentions, empty handed
It's a feeling that we both know too well
Midnight in the cemetery
This day started ordinary
But now I'm wishing I could slow thе whole world down
Is it crazy if we stay herе all night long?
Everybody needs a way to hold on
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Longer
Sunrise in the cemetery
Last night started ordinary
Somehow I wish I could slow the whole world downEmbed
