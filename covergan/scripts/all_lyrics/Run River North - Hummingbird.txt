Hummingbird Lyrics
I can't explain how much this...

Light speed at the crack of dawn
Hummingbird with the high beams on
But I see no faults, I fall, I'm falling, falling
I'm in love with the summer set rays
Someone cut me off one more lane
I'll go until you call just
Don't leave me hanging on this line

I can't explain how much it hurts
Every second's getting worse
I can't stand to see you falling
There's not a next time, just a flat line
You're losing more than what you're worth
I can't explain how much it hurts
Every second's getting worse
I can't stand to see you falling
There's not a next time, just a flat line
You're losing morе than what you're worth

Light speed at the crack of dawn
Hummingbird with the high bеams on
But I see no faults, I fall, I'm falling, falling
I'm in love with the summer set rays
Someone cut me off one more lane
I'll go until you call just
Don't leave me hanging on this line
I can't explain how much it hurts
Every second's getting worse
I can't stand to see you falling
There's not a next time, just a flat line
You're losing more than what you're worth

(Say you told me so, say you told me so
It's inevitable, it's inevitable
Can't take this with me, why?
Can't take this with me, why?
Can't take this with me, why?)

I can't explain how much this hurts
I can't explain how much it hurts
(I can't explain how much this hurts)
Every second's getting worse
(Every second's getting worse)
I can't stand to see you falling
(I can't stand to see you falling)
There's not a next time, just a flat line
You're losing more than what you're worthEmbed
