One For Me LyricsStraight to my face you called me the
Greatest liar you've ever seen and I
Would have got upset but there's a
Part of me that just believes you
Probably know me better than I
Do you want to keep
Believing in me?
I couldn't face it right now
If you asked me to leave
I get I wasn't your first choice
But I know you're the one for me
Now it's the middle of the night
With our heads through the wall
Telling you it's worth the fight
This ain't just a free for all
You're thе one for me
Monday Tuesday whеn did I go
Wrong the words are swirling in my
Mind is bending over backwards
Hoping that we'll laugh after it's through
I couldn't face it right now
If you asked me to leave
I get I wasn't your first choice
But I know you're the one for me
Now it's the middle of the night
With our heads through the wall
Telling you it's worth the fight
This ain't just a free for all
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
I couldn't face it right now
If you asked me to leave
I get I wasn't your first choice
But I know you're the one for me
Now it's the middle of the night
With our heads through the wall
Telling you it's worth the fight
This ain't just a free for all
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
(You're the one for me)
You're the one for me
(You're the one for me)
You're the one for me
(You're the one for me)
You're the one for meEmbed
