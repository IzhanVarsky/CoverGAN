Spiders LyricsSpiders up the wall
Up to the ceilin'
I can't shake 'em off
'Cause no one sees them
Why the silly face
When the room's so serious
No one's happy
And it's never enough
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
It's just the way it is for now
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
It's just the way it is for now
Feel like I'm losin' my head
Caught up in the
Pieces don't seem to fit
Don't leave me in
The middle of your web
Spinnin' yeses and noes
I can't make sense
Of what you don't even know
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
It's just the way it is for now
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
It's just the way it is for now
Lately I've been stuck like gum
Under the desk of classroom I once slept in
Chewed all of its flavor and love
The bubble never blew up
The basket was just too far
I think I'm goin' too far
Don't remember where I parked
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
It's just the way it is for now
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
It's just the way it is for now
The basket was just too far
I think I'm goin' too far
Don't remember where I parkedEmbed
