Lick Lyrics

Cameras on its lit
You're just what I want
Hope Im not the lick
Lick

All alone livin' in the A
She's illegal so she's selling yay
Pretty face gets her what she wants
Even freedom from the local cops
So she hears somebody wants some weight
And of course they wanna' cop from her
So she tells her homies time to ride
And go and hide
Cause we're about to hit a lick

Cameras on its lit
You're just what I want
Hope Im not the lick
Lick

I could feel you from across the street
Look both ways before you crossin' me
You gassed cause you ride around bussin' come ups
But pump yo brakes and lift yo tongue up
Cause Im not the lick
That opportunist smell didn't take long to permeate
Djsfahladsjfhlasdkjf
I'm nervous wait
Im tryna' put her in her place and tell her
Stop killing these dreams
You just fucking up the murder rate
Cameras on its lit
You're just what I want
Hope Im not the lick
