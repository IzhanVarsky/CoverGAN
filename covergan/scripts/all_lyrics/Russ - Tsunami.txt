Tsunami Lyrics
Yeah, I pay my dues and get paid for it, too
The outcome of my input is my favorite review
I do the work of two and half men like Charlie Sheen
This is what you get when you don't care about the party scene
So pardon me if I don't really look amused
I'm just shootin' for the masses like I'm tryna make the news
All this winning by myself, got these labels all confused
I should do a deal with a Nike 'cause these checks are comin' soon, ooh
Am I the only one lifted?
The money ain't as fun when you're the only one with it
I need a smaller table and a bigger fence
I see these leeches campin' out, it's like they live in tents
I'm too advanced for your advances, man, I'm feelin godly
Russ is the wave, nah, Russ the tsunami
Te quieres casar conmigo, yeah, they want me
This is for my Spanish girls in Brooklyn screaming, "Papi"
Everybody's in the same game, different levels with it
Same hell, different devils with it, yeah
Lemme tell you how my life feel
This past year has felt like a high light reel
I chew my beats and I spit out anthems
If you wanna stand out gotta be outstanding
I know what I gotta do to make my mom stop crying
Trying times doesn't mean it's time to stop trying
I'm flying with wings that grew from leaps of faith
Feelin star struck every time I see my face
Oh that's crazy talk ain't it?
I'm just gassed off my drive, though
Whole album fire, I might call the shit, "Pyro"
I could go to Saudi, make 20 racks a night
By the time this comes out, it's probably 5 times the price
5 mics use to mean something, nowadays I don't give a fuck
About your magazine it means nothing
I change the world by example, not by my words
I move around with a handful of people that know they worth
Ain't no playin us, we were born to make a dent
We understand that there's way more to life than just paying rent
But speaking of rent, I think we bout to lose the house
Think they repo-ing the cars, think we gotta sell the couch
Think they cuttin' off the lights, think they turnin' off the water
And I'm still turnin' down every single label offer
Top prospect, projected high draft pick
I'm in my own league, though
Own my own team, though
Making hooks like lay ups and verses like free throws
I beat the game and I ain't even use a cheat code
You hatin' from the stands, I'm ballin out, peep the seats, though
Too young for this wisdom, make them wanna check ID, though
I been psychic, motherfuckers doubted
I suggest you listen when I talk and shut your mouth
It's very evident I know some shit you don't
What you gonna do if they don't send a boat
Better learn to swim lil' guppy3Embed
