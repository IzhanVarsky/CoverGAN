If I could come back
If I could come back
If I could come back
If I could come back
If I could come back
If I could come back
On the earth once again
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you-ou-ou

You do it again, again, again, again, again
Always left one more step to catch you,catch you, catch you, catch you
You do it again, again, again, again, again
Always left one more step to catch you,catch you, catch you, catch you
You do it again, again, again, again, again
You do it again, again, again, again
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you

How do we do
By the time realized, we grew old like this in a flash and so
How do we feel
If we never find each other cause both have bad eyesight
How do we do
By the time realized, it’s time to say goodbye, my life
How do we do
Until I come back to earth to see you againEmbed
