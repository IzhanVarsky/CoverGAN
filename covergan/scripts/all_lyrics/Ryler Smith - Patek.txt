Patek Lyrics
Ain't got no time for slow
Ain't got no time for those
Make sure my mind my own
Make sure these dials ain't wrong
Ain't got no time for slow
Ain't got no time for those
Make sure my mind my own
Make sure these dials ain't wrong


Splittin the crumbles
Livin off pennies why we remain humble
In the jungle plenty snakes and piranhas try to slump you
Y'all acting like petty toddlers
Eat up at Benihana's
As we go to Bentley's from Honda's
They get heated like saunas
Fuck your fake ass persona trace up no honor
Shit ain't all prada or gucci
When you forced a blue collar
With the armada always on time like patek
Stylin' on point you see no gold on my neck uh
Style irregular smoke the stash up presto
Sauce we whip it like pesto
Never finesse low (that's known)
Bust it spread the mustard
This shit for old school hustlers
Trades of no customs stay bumpin'
In those subways and busses uh
Rappers get pushed back further no mercy
From Harlem around the whole globe back up to New Jersey
From south of London to Shanghai
Cousin verbally equipped son they love my function
Bust out the lewis a sudden intuitive feeling
Too dirty to groove with it
Y'all want the new wave I'm giving em numerous
Gotta be said that contenders consuming him
With subtle maneuvers we taking the tip of the berg
I'm crazy so fuck with it
Raising it up, the name public I summoned it
All of my people they part of it
Uh huh
Poppa always said money gon' turn most peeps to greed
Addicted like speed
I'm tipping no scale for these petty odds
Niggas too dramatic always on point now partner
Like dials right on the patek watch
See us get bigger with every bid that biddin' up
Gotta be clean or be bitter up on the rough
Ain't a man who been depending on better luck
Tried to force it that shit was useless
Found a new source of peace of mind
Now I don't need excuses fuck y'all

Ain't got no time for slow
Ain't got no time for those
Make sure my mind my own
Make sure these dials ain't wrong
Ain't got no time for slow
Ain't got no time for those
Make sure my mind my own
Make sure these dials ain't wrongEmbed
