Bye Lyrics
Save me

Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting?
It's too late for mending
Now I'm gonna drown, drown
Drown to my end

Was it my fault?
Everyone 'round me just want me to fall
Nobody cares, that's why they don't call
Such a big world, I always feel small
Talking to God, like "I sent a message, why won't you respond?"
I feel like heaven's so far, yeah
My demons, they lurk in the dark
No, I do not wanna spark
No, I do not wanna sin
Maybe that's why he isn't listening yeah, yeah
Wish I can fly away, wish I can be in another place
I'm finna disappear with no chase
Too many secrets I'll take to my grave
Really wanted to be safe but I'll accept my fate, yeah

Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting?
It's too late for mending
Now I'm gonna drown, drown
Drown to my end
Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting
It's too late for mending
Now I'm gonna drown, drown
Drown to my end
I wish I'd known, I fell in love with the feelings
I saw all my friends disappearing, what have you done?
You turn me into a spirit
While you living life without meaning
Too many fucks we were not giving
Thinking your chest isn't part of my stuff
I don't need closure
I need you to open your heart and show me a little of love

Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting?
It's too late for mending
Now I'm gonna drown, drown
Drown to my end1Embed
