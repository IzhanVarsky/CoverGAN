Fire in the Sky Lyrics
We just move on a minute
We go first on a second
If the sky is the limit
Our earth is the blessing
Every second you're in it, every minute your guessing
Cause the celebration into this life that you're slipping
Slip, sliding away and you know it's never enough
You're begging for more and so on your knees you get up
We are the poetry in motion
We are the fire in the sky

Slip sliding with purpose into the black into
The sky and stars and feeling a suggestion
That we weren't all connected in the essence
Of a final plan much bigger than us
Like a memory that you just can't touch

Like the universe is a circle and its basic
And the world spins round cause everything changes
And the resting place of the human race
Is the sky and stars and the poetry is just us
Its just us
Its just us
In every city we live in
We take the chance that we're given
We take the day at it's worth, we speak the truth that we listen
We make the dream unreal, we make the rebel to god
We make the hero forever and make each other the law
And I never felt it before in the way that I feel it now
Cause in the air that we breathe in create the life that we love
So until we meet again I am forever your friend

Slip sliding with purpose into the black into
The sky and stars and feeling a suggestion
That we weren't all connected in the essence
Of a final plan much bigger than us
Like a memory that you just can't touch

Like the universe is a circle and its basic
And the world spins round cause everything changes
And the resting place of the human race
Is the sky and stars and the poetry is just us
Its just us
Its just us

We just move on a minute
We go first on a second
If the sky is the limit
Our earth is the blessing
Every second you're in it, every minute your guessing
Cause the celebration into this life that you're slipping
Slip, sliding away and you know it's never enough
You're begging for more and so on your knees you get up
We are the poetry in motion
We are the fire in the sky
Slip sliding with purpose into the black into
The sky and stars and feeling a suggestion
That we weren't all connected in the essence
Of a final plan much bigger than us
Like a memory that you just can't touch

Like the universe is a circle and its basic
And the world spins round cause everything changes
And the resting place of the human race
Is the sky and stars and the poetry is just us
Its just usEmbed
