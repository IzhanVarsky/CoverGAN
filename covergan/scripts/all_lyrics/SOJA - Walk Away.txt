Walk Away Lyrics
I heard them say
That this is all
That what we see
Is what we got
I seen them pray
To their pockets, and they’re
Still not happy
At all
But I feel a breeze
And I feel it blow
And I feel it come
And I feel it go
And I know there’s something
That I just don’t know
Cause I can’t see
What I never saw

You cannot ignore it
When you walk away
Cause it’s still right there
Every day
It’s in your bloodstream
And it’s there to stay
Even when you
Walk away
You cannot ignore it
When you walk away
Cause it’s still right there
Every day
It’s in your bloodstream
And it’s there to stay
Even when you
Walk away
It’s in your soul
It’s in your soul

Tell me the reason
That when you dream
You go to places
That you’ve never been
Tell me the reason
You recognize
Someone you never
Met in Your life...
Answer this question
Why are we here?
Loving each other
Why do we care?
Why do we move
When it’s easy to stall?
Why do we rise up
When it’s easier to fall?
You cannot ignore it
When you walk away
Cause it’s still right there
Every day
It’s in your bloodstream
And it’s there to stay
Even when you
Walk away
You cannot ignore it
When you walk away
Cause it’s still right there
Every day
It’s in your bloodstream
And it’s there to stay
Even when you
Walk away
It’s in your soul
It’s in your soul
It’s in your soul
It’s in your soul
Even when you
Walk away
It’s in your soul2Embed
