All the Way Over Lyrics
It's kinda getting good with him
I guess that's how it should, it's been over a year since you and me
But now he's asking what this is (asking what this is)
And any other girl would be able to answer easily

'cause he kisses me right too
But I don't want to admit that
Sometimes it feels like you
Yeah, I don't want to admit that
This could be something new
Yeah, I still can't commit 'cause
Doesn't that mean that, mean that, mean that it's over

That it's all the way over
That it's all the way over

I want to tell him what he wants
I try to say that I could never go back to what we were
He don't believe that
I don't even believe that when
You're in my head, he's in my bed
And I hate that I feel that
'cause
'cause he kisses me right too
But I don't want to admit that
Sometimes it feels like you, oh
Yeah, I don't want to admit that
This could be something new
Yeah, I still can't commit 'cause
Doesn't that mean that, mean that, mean that it's over

That it's all the way over
Yeah doesn't that mean that it's over
That it's all the way over
I kinda wanna fall for you all the way over

That it's all the way over
Is it all the way over
Doesn't that mean that it's over
That it's all the way over
I kinda wanna fall for you all the way over1Embed
