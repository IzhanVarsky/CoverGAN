​hypotheticals Lyrics
Don't you think it's about time that you unblocked
Me?
No I don't wanna stalk you
Just wanna see what you're up to
Are you hanging with that girl from your
Hometown?
Is she glad to have you back, have you around?
Now I'm brushing my teeth
And feeling guilty
Sleeping ugly
'Cause you're not lying next to me
Sober thinking that I might be better off
'til I'm drinking I'm a shot away from hitting you up

Maybe if I cut my hair, changed up all the clothes I
Wear, acted like I didn't care
Would you love me then, baby would you love me?
Maybe if I changed my face, owned up to the mess
I made, turned around our old mistakes
Would you love me then, baby would you love me?

Not usually the jealous type
So stupid these hypotheticals
Got me taking bad advice
My minds running
Is she a red hot lover like her lipstick?
You can't tell me that she's better sucking your (uh)
I'm not perfect but we had our moments
Now you're not lying next to me
Maybe if I cut my hair, changed up all the clothes I
Wear, acted like I didn't care
Would you love me then, baby would you love me?
Maybe if I changed my face, owned up to the mess
I made, turned around our old mistakes
Would you love me then, baby would you love me?

I know I'm hard to love
I know it's hard to trust me I can
Barely trust myself
(I barely trust myself)

But maybe if I cut my hair, changed up all the
Clothes i wear, acted like i didn't care
Would you love me then, baby would you love me?1Embed
