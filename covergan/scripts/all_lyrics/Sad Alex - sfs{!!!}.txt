S.f.s Lyrics
I feel a cloud full of doom
It follows me in the room
You can't get through to me
I've been this way for so long
I hear them asking "what's wrong?"
I don't got shit to say

Crying into a bottle
I'll try to be good tomorrow
But for tonight I'm being me
Find a bad boy distraction
Excuses for all my actions
Let's numb the pain together, babe

I'm so fucking sad all the time
I got a glass half empty in my mind
Cause I'm a cynical, clinical, cyclical bitch
With a love addiction I cannot quit
I'm so fucking sad all the time
I got a glass half empty in my mind
Cause I'm a cynical, clinical, cyclical bitch
With a love addiction, so
Kiss me
(Know what makes me)
(Kiss me)
(Know what makes me)

Why do you ask me to smile
When I don't wanna smile?
I know you're scared of me, but
Can you stay for a while?

Crying into a bottle
I'll try to be good tomorrow
But for tonight I'm being me
Find a bad boy distraction
Excuses for all my actions
Let's numb the pain together, babe

I'm so fucking sad all the time
I got a glass half empty in my mind
Cause I'm a cynical, clinical, cyclical bitch
With a love addiction I cannot quit
So fuckin' sad
All the time
I got a glass half empty
In my mind
Cause I'm a cynical, clinical, cyclical bitch
With a love addiction, so
Kiss me
(Know what makes me)
(Know what makes me)

So fucking sad I know
(Know what makes me)
So fucking sad I know
(Know what makes me)
(Kiss me)Embed
