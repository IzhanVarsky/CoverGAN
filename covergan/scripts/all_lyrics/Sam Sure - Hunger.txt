Hunger Lyrics
Gonna call when I make it home
So bored when I'm on my own because of you
Only for you
My heart's beating upon my sleeve
Try'na figure out if you mean the things you do
(Only for you)

And I know you can't even think right now
And advice is something I can live without
Oh Lord, oh Lord
And you should hold your breath from behind your texts
A second guess, all the things, they're right around my head
No more, no less, than chemicals and pheromones
Oh, hell no

(Pitch shift sample: "Do-Beating")
Only for you, you
Only for you, you
Only for you, you

It was a question, not an accusation
A play on words just to change your face
And I was running like I do
Try'na to teach you things you already knew
Oh, Why do I interrupt
Make you feel you're not enough
If I make you feel like I want more
That's not the way I feel at all
(Pitch shift sample: "Do-Beating")
When it comes to you
When it comes to us
Oh, When it comes to you
When it comes to love

(Pitch shift sample: "Do-Beating")
Only for you, you
Only for you, you
Only for you, you
Only for you, you
Only for you, you

Only for you, you
Only for you, you
Only for you, you2Embed
