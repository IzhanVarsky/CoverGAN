In This House Lyrics
Give me everything you have
Bring what you can hold
I can make a space
Love, I know you must be tired
To travel all this way
I'm happy to accommodate you

In this house
All I have is yours to give
In this house
You never have to leave

You and me
Travelling this empty road alone
But I can see
A place for us to make ourselves a home
And oh my god
I could fall in love with you
Oh my god
Tell me what I have to do
Here's the place where we will rest
And happily we'll die
After years of summertime
Here's the place where we will love
And here is where we'll cry
For the ones we leave behind

In this house
All I have is yours to give
In this house
You never have to leave

You and me
Travelling this empty road alone
But I can see
A place for us to make ourselves a home
And oh my god
I could fall in love with you
Oh my god
Tell me what I have to do
In this house
In this house, in this house

You and me
Travelling this empty road alone
But I can see
A place for us to make ourselves a home
And oh my god
I could fall in love with you
Oh my god
Tell me what I have to do, to fall in love with you
In this house
In this houseEmbed
