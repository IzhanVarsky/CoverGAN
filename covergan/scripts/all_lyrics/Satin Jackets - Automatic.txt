Automatic Lyrics
It feels like, it's automatic
What you do to me makes me feel alive
When I'm rolling with you, still automatic
Won't tell no lie
This is how I feel

Don't know how it will turn out
But I'm hoping it will last (oh oh oh)
Don't know how it will turn out
But I'm hoping it will last (oh oh oh)

When it's you
(When I'm here with you)
And me
Still automatic
When it's you
(When I'm here with you)
This feeling's automatic
It's you
(When I'm here with you)
And me
Still automatic
When it's you
(When I'm here with you)
This feeling's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

Shifts into place
I can feel it now
Coming over me
Ah-ah ah-ah
When I'm hanging out with you
Still automatic
Although I'm growing older
I feel the same

It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
Just you, and me
When it's you, and me
Just you, and me
When it's you, and me
Just you, and me
When it's you, and me
Just you, and me
When it's you, and me
Just you, and me
When it's you, and me
Just you, and me
When it's you, and meEmbed
