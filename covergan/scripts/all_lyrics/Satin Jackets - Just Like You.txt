Just Like You LyricsI told you many times I'm not like you
But you said you felt I'm in love with you too
I couldn't stop thinking we saw differently
Still you managed to bring out the best of me
If I could do it I would undo that I had to lose you
To realise I want you
I think it got me thinking just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
I told you many times I'm not like you
You broke my heart when I broke yours into two
Suddenly the party's where I knew you'd be
Became so much more important to me
If I could do it I would undo that I had to lose you
To realise I want you
I think it got me thinking just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
On the couch
You and I
Talk all night
Every time
Why is it so hard to stay away?
On the couch
You and I
Talk all night
Every time
Why is it so hard to stay away?
If I could do it I would undo that I had to lose you
To realise I want you
I think it got me thinking just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like youEmbed
