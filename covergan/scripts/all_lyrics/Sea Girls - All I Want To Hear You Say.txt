All I Want To Hear You Say Lyrics
Your body shape was a warning sign
With a face made for TV
I knew it was only just a matter of time
You were caught in the headlights of your dream

Now we live in different worlds
'Cause I’m still working shifts
While you’re putting on pearls
And I just want to know
If you’re in Manchester will you come to my show?
And say

How you doing?
Well, I want you to know that I am doing
Better than I was before
How you doing?
Well, I want you to know
That really
I’m on your news feed twice a day
I see you in the papers, I go to all your plays
And even if I want to, I can't look away
It ain't easy to forget you
It’s all I want to hear you say
Sometimes I dream about you running away
You bring your hair and makeup to my flat
Oh, heaven on earth is a hell of a place
No one can judge me for trying to get back

But that was a while ago
And our delicate youth is starting to get old
And I just want to know
If you’re in town tonight
I’d like to say hello and

How you doing?
Well, I want you to know that I am doing
Better than I was before
How you doing?
Well, I want you to know
That really
I’m on your news feed twice a day
I see you in the papers, I go to all your plays
And even if I want to, I can't look away
It ain't easy to forget you
It’s all I want to hear you say
I want to hear you say
There’s a part of me you’ll take away forever
And that would do
So, how you doing?
Well, I want you to know that I am doing
Better than I was before

How you doing?
Well, I want you to know that I am doing
Better than I was before
How you doing?
Well, I want you to know
That really
I’m on your news feed twice a day
I see you in the papers, I go to all your plays
And even if I want to, I can't look away
It ain't easy to forget you
It’s all I want to hear you say

Even if I want to
I can't look away
It ain't easy to forget you
It’s all I want to hear you sayEmbed
