Iron Hearted Lyrics
I've heard it all, heard it all before
You'll say you're sorry, then you promise me no more
No more deceit, no more will I cheat
Every time I hear these lines I know I'm done believing

I've been getting used to feeling useless
Finding comfort in the abuse I guess
I've been counting to ten while holding my breath
But it never seems work like they said
I guess I'm out of step
Out of sight, out of mind
Why can't I just l–µave you behind?
Would you even notice if I was gone?
'Cause you don't talk, don't try
You don't stress and you don't cry
I don't believe you, you've lied many times
So is this done? Have you won?
Did I lose? Will I run?
Will I be able to live on my own?
I'm just the

Unfortunate one
You're gonna lose in the long run
I'm not iron hearted (I'm not iron hearted)
I feel everything in ways uncharted (Ways uncharted)
Always unguarded (Always unguarded)
'Cause I'm not, I'm not iron hearted

Don't you
Test me I'm on edge and I'm over it
You made your point
You only want me just for the hell of it
Knocked down
You've left in the dust to get up again
I've tried and tried to fall out of love
I guess I'm just the

Unfortunate one (Unfortunate one)
You're gonna lose in the long run (You're gonna lose in the long run)
Unfortunate fate (Unfortunate fate)
I'm always out of place

I'm not iron hearted (I'm not iron hearted)
I feel everything in ways uncharted (Ways uncharted)
Always unguarded (Always unguarded)
'Cause I'm not, I'm not iron hearted
Everything's distorted (Everything's distorted)
I can't see a way out of the darkness (Of the darkness)
I'm just disregarded (I'm just disregarded)
'Cause I'm not, I'm not iron hearted
Is this where we say goodbye?Embed
