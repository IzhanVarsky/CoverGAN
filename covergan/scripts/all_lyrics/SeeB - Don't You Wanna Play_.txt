Don’t You Wanna Play? Lyrics
I keep going over
Every moment in my head
If I only told ya
Would it matter if I said?
I want you 'round me all the time
And not just every other night
I'm tired of pretending like
We going nowhere

Let's not overthink it
Let's just say it like it is
You know we have a good thing
Not just friends with benefits

Let's call it love
Call it whatever you want
Together we're bulletproof
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?

Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?
I'm wearing your t-shirt
And I don't wanna take it off
It's my little secret
And I can't get enough
Of every little thing you do
So why you stepping 'round the truth?
You're feeling me, I'm feeling you
What are we doing?

Let's not overthink it
Let's just say it like it is
You know we have a good thing
Not just friends with benefits

Let's call it love
Call it whatever you want
Together we're bulletproof
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?

Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little
Play a little longer
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?1Embed
