Sad in Scandinavia Lyrics
So sad
So sad

I travelled all this way so I could cover up the past
Paint myself a future where the happiness would last
I don't know how to let you go
I'd go anywhere if it would give me peace of mind
How'd you run away from someone you can't leave behind?
I don't know how to let you go

Now I'm feeling sad in Scandinavia
Can't stand the rain and I
Just can't get away from you
Wish I could change the way I feel about you now
Feel about you now
Got me feeling sad in Scandinavia
Counting the days 'til I'm
Over all the nights with you
Wish I could fight the way I feel about you now
Feel about you now, oh

So sad
So sad for you
Looking at a stranger, and I see your silhouette
Get that familiar feeling of a tightness in my chest
I don't know how to let you go
Some days I'm so close to moving on that I forget
I'm still holding on to all the baggage that you left
I don't know if I could let you go

Now I'm feeling sad in Scandinavia
Can't stand the rain and I
Just can't get away from you
Wish I could change the way I feel about you now
Feel about you now
Got me feeling sad in Scandinavia
Counting the days 'til I'm
Over all the nights with you
Wish I could fight the way I feel about you now
Feel about you now, oh

So sad
So sad for you

Now I'm feeling sad in Scandinavia
Counting the days 'til I'm
Over all the nights with you
Wish I could fight the way I feel about you now
Feel about you now, oh
So sad
So sadEmbed
