Safe Zone Lyrics
I avoid goin' out on a Saturday night, mm, mm
'Cause the bars that I like is where your friends hanging out, mm, mm

Been taking me forever
To get over what we had, yeah
I don't think that I can handle to see your face
'Cause you know me way too well
Know my head, know my heart
Would be no way out

I hide inside my walls
And the one place you don't go
My own, my safe zone
Behind my skin and bones
Is the one place you don't go
My own, my safe zone
So don't take me out
Of this state of mind
'Cause you don't wanna see me on the other side
Let me hide inside my walls
In the one place you don't go (Go, go, go, go)
My safe zone
I hide inside my walls
I hide inside my walls

Still don't know what I'd say if I saw you today, mm, mm
Stacking notes to myself but I know that won't help, mm, mm

Been taking me forever
To get over what we had, yeah
I don't think that I can handle to see your face
'Cause you know me way too well
Know my head, know my heart
Would be no way out

I hide inside my walls
And the one place you don't go
My own, my safe zone
Behind my skin and bones
Is the one place you don't go
My own, my safe zone
So don't take me out
Of this state of mind
'Cause you don't wanna see me on the other side
Let me hide inside my walls
In the one place you don't go (Go, go, go, go)
My safe zone
I hide inside my walls
I hide inside my walls

So don't take me out
Of this state of mind
'Cause you don't wanna see me on the other side
Let me hide inside my walls
In the one place you don't go (Go, go, go, go)
My safe zone
My safe zone
My safe zoneEmbed
