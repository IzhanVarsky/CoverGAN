Lie Lyrics
Fight then we break up
Kiss then we make up
It's driving me too insane now, oh
When we keep going nowhere
Too stuck in the air
The way you keep playing me, no fair, oh

'Cause every little thing you do
Keep tearing my heart in two
Tearing my heart in two, oh-oh-oh
And every little word you say
Caught me in a hurricane
A hurricane

You lie, lie, lie to me
Keep saying I'm your everything
Lie, lie, lie to me
Act like you would do anything
Lie, lie, lie to me
Like I don't know what's happening
Lie, lie, lie to me
Lie, lie, lie to me
You got my heart on all these different chains
But you don't got guts to look me in the face
It's like you chew me up
And then you spit me ou-ou-out
Guess you don't care that much
Just wanna mess me u-u-up
And no matter what I do
I can't try to change you

You lie, lie, lie to me
Keep saying I'm your everything
Lie, lie, lie to me
Act like you would do anything
Lie, lie, lie to me
Like I don't know what's happening
What's happening, oh-oh-oh
You lie, lie, lie to me
Keep saying we're the perfect two
Lie, lie, lie to me
Act like it's only me and you
Lie, lie, lie to me
Like I don't even have a clue
Lie, lie, lie to me
Lie, lie, lie to me
We're too busy living seperate lives
We're too busy living seperate lives
What's happening

You lie, lie, lie to me
Keep saying I'm your everything
Lie, lie, lie to me
Act like you would do anything
Lie, lie, lie to me
Like I don't know what's happening
Lie, lie, lie to me
Lie, lie, lie to me2Embed
