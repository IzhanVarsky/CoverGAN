GET UP Lyrics
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

I know you're clingin' to the light of day
To tell you everything's A-okay
And medication don't do much
Yeah, it just numbs the brain

Guess you might say I'm a little intense
I'm on the bright side of bein' hell bent
So, take it from me, you're not the only one
Who can't see straight (Can't see straight)

If you were ever in doubt
Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
But you gotta try, and I'm callin' out

Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long?
Get up, get up, get a move on
Stop stallin', I'm callin' out
Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me (Trust me)
Everybody wants to sing their song
So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"
Ain't nothin' normal when it comes to you and me
I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams

If you were ever in doubt
Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
But you gotta try, so I'm callin' out

Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long?
Get up, get up, get a move on
Stop stallin', I'm callin' out
Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me

Yeah, I don't know why I never talk about it
I guess that's probably part of the problem
Yeah
Sometimes you're wrong... sometimes you're right
Just gotta keep movin'
Yeah
I'm just gonna keep movin'
Today, tomorrow, and the next
Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long
Get up, get up, get a move on
Stop stallin', I'm callin' out
Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me8Embed
