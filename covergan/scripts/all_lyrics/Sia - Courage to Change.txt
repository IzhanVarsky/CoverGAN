Courage to Change Lyrics
World, I want to leave you better
I want my life to matter
I am afraid I have no purpose here
I watch the news on TV
Abandon myself daily
I am afraid to let you see the real me

Rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Pouring on me
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
We don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)

You’re not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
World, you're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together we can do anything
I want to leave you better
I want my life to matter
I am afraid I have no purpose here

The rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Pouring on me
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
You don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)

You're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)

You’re not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything

You're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything6Embed
