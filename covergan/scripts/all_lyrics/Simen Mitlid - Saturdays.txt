Saturdays LyricsYou, called me to say things are different but I'm still the same
I'm, too restless still waiting for something to change us with fate
Won't be long now
Pretend I'm nowhere around
Everything keeps on floating
Everyone keeps on coasting
Save it for the morning
I'll take anything that will force me to make up my mind
While, you're going back to the habits you had before mine
Try to break it all down
Pretend I'm nowhere around
Everything keeps on floating
Everyone keeps on coasting
Save it for the morningEmbed
