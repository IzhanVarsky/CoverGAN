Rise Lyrics(Rise!)
Get yourselves together
(Rise!)
Stand up and live your life
(Rise!)
Get yourselves together
(Rise!)
Hands up, hands up high
Stand up to the devil slowly rising
Clear your throat now
You can cough for their demise
Speak out, don't let the status quo define you
This is your world, just put the fear back in their eyes
There comes a time when you know there's a problem
Rise up, it's a dawn of a new day
Hands up, it's gonna be okay
Even when they strangle you, get yourselves together
Strike down all that oppose you
Look now, what have they sold you
Even if they anger you, get yourselves together
(Rise!)
Get yourself together!
(Rise!)
Stand up and live your life!
(Rise!)
Get yourselves together!
Wake up, this could be your finest hour
Pick your head up, and get your body off the floor
Hey now, don't be afraid to fight for something
This is your chance, and you can stand for so much more
There comes a time when you know there's a problem
Rise up, it's a dawn of a new day
Hands up, it's gonna be okay
Even when they strangle you, get yourselves together
Strike down all that oppose you
Look now, what have they sold you
Even if they anger you, get yourselves together
(Rise!)
(Rise!)
Get yourselves together!
(Rise!)
Stand up and live your life!
Rise up, it's the dawn of a new day
Hands up, it's gonna be okay
Even when they strangle you, get yourselves together
Strike down all that oppose you
Look now, what have they sold you
Even if they anger you, get yourselves together
Get yourselves together
(Rise!)1Embed
