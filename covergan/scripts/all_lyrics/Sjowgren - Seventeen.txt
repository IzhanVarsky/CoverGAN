Seventeen LyricsI know I can't (I know I can't)
I can't be everything
All in one (All in one)
Just the one for you
We make up
Up some pieces (Pieces)
We're puzzle pieces
We fit, all adding up
We fit, all adding up

If you want a second to breathe
I'll give you all of my love
I'll give you all that you need, yeah
Don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
Not going nowhere
I'm not going nowhere, yeah
If you want a second to breathe
I'll give you all of my love
I'll give you all that you need, yeah
Don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
Not going nowhere
I'm not going nowhere, yeah
I balance act (I balance act)
I fill up everything
Down to one (Down to one)
Just the one, it's you
You make up
Up a piece it's (Pieces)
My favorite piece and
You fit all adding up
You fit all adding up
Badada dumm badummm
Badada dumm badummm

If you want a second to breathe
I'll give you all of my love

So won't, so won't you come and join me?
