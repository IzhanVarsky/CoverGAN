Star Roving Lyrics
Give it away now, girl
Can't hold down tonight
Every black and white
Secret's a blinking light
Emma flies a kite
Said she's feeling love for everyone tonight
Although possible
Said she's feeling good, said she's feeling good

Smiling beautiful
She says I make it best
For everyone to hide
Twisting around my girl
Nothing left to lose
Nothing left to fight

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Give it away now, girl
Can't hold on to mine
Every black and white
Secret's seeking light
In a flash of time
Said she's feeling love for everyone tonight
Smiling beautiful
She says I make it best for everyone tonight

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh8Embed
