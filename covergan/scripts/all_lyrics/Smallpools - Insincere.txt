Insincere Lyrics
I'm sorry, sorry to kill the vibe
But my head ain't feeling right
I started something I couldn't stop
And it haunts me day and night

And I'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?
The words are never clear
And always insincere
They're always insincere
And will the hounds come and sniff me out? (Hey!)
And I'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?
The words are never clear
And always insincere
They're always insincere
And will the hounds come and sniff me out? (Hey!)

Dream me, stream me, glued to the TV
My mind is out of sight
Build me, kill me, right click to fill me
Up and elevate your life
And we'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?
The words are never clear
And always insincere
And I'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?
They're always insincere
They're always insincere
And will the hounds come and sniff me out?
And I'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?

It seems that I've been here before
But without the keys, stuck at the door
(Will we ever get outta here?)
It seems that I've been here before
But without the keys, stuck at the door

And I'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?
The words are never clear
And always insincere
They're always insincere
And will the hounds come and sniff me out?
And I'll never get outta here
Will we ever get outta here?
They're always insincere
They're always insincere1Embed
