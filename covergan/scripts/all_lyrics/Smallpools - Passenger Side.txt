Passenger Side Lyrics
Weekend bracelets on
Blast our favorite songs
And I know what's dead is gone
But there's something holding on
When I think back to the ways

Where I would steer
From the passenger side
While you slip your bra
From your ripped t shirt
Cause it's hot as a mother
Got sweat on each other yeah
I miss those desert drives
From the passenger side
From the passenger side
I miss those desert drives
From the passenger side

Get me through state lines
Precious cargo rides
And I wonder where you are now
Are you riding with your top down
With somebody else now
Does he keep you in the lines
Where I would steer
From the passenger side
While you slip your bra
From your ripped t shirt
Cause it's hot as a mother
Got sweat on each other yeah
I miss those desert drives
From the passenger side
From the passenger side
I miss those desert drives
From the passenger side

I feel that you might have always been right
And we may not find partners in crime
Better in life than we've had this whole time
So if you're alone just watching the sky
Losing your mind and you don't know why
And you wanna try going for one more ride

I could steer from the passenger side
While you switch the song
From your cracked iPhone
As we fall from each other
On quest for new lovers yeah
I miss those Vegas lights
From the passenger side
From the passenger side
I miss those desert drives
From the passenger side6Embed
