Not the Same LyricsAre you doing alright tonight?
I hope you’re doin fine
I wouldn’t know I haven’t talked to you in a while
Don’t think anything happened
We just grew apart
So friendship was I don’t know where we are
But I could listen to you talk
While we went on a walk
But you don’t know my name anymore
It doesn’t roll off your tongue
When you think of having fun
It’s not the same but I don’t know what I’m asking for
Who have you been telling my secrets to
I’m so paranoid thanks to you
I would call you up but I’m too anxious
I’m afraid you’d won’t pick up so I’d just leave it how it is
But I could listen to you talk
While we went on a walk
But you don’t know my name anymore
It doesn’t roll off your tongue
When you think of having fun
It’s not the same but I don’t know what I’m asking for
But I could listen to you talk
While we went on a walk
But you don’t know my name anymore
It doesn’t roll off your tongue
When you think of having fun
It’s not the same but I don’t know what I’m asking for
But I could listen to you talk
While we went on a walk
But you don’t know my name anymore
It doesn’t roll off your tongue
When you think of having fun
It’s not the same but I don’t know what I’m asking forEmbed
