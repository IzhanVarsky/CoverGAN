Replay LyricsShawty's like a melody in my head
Shawty's like a melody in my head
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
(That I can't keep out, got me singin' like)
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall with your friends
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, yeah
Shawty's like a melody in my head
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
(That I can't keep out, got me singin' like)
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Girl, you really changed my life
Doing things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking what she like
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday, I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, yeah
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
(That I can't keep out, got me singin' like)
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
I can be your melody
A guy that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me (ayy)
I can be your melody
A guy that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me (ayy)
I can be your melody
A guy that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me (ayy)
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ayEmbed
