Welcome To My Mind Lyrics
I live in my head I'm in here all alone
Let nobody in I'm better on my own
Overthinking every day, every day, every day
Keeping me awake every day, every day
I know I should clean it before I let you see it

Welcome to my mind
It's a little dark sometimes
But I'm turning off all of these lights
So you can see what it's like

Where I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
In my head I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
Up on this cloud, up in the stars
Wanna come down but I'm falling too far
So I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay

Hearing things I think I've gone delirious
I don't know why I always act so serious
You can make all okay, all okay, all okay
You make me wanna change, wanna change, wanna change
My head is so haunted
I'm afraid to be honest
Welcome to my mind
It's a little dark sometimes
But I'm turning off all of these lights
So you can see what it's like

Where I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
In my head I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
Up on this cloud, up in the stars
Wanna come down but I'm falling too far
So I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stayEmbed
