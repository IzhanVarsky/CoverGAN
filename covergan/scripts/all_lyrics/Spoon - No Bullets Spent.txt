No Bullets Spent Lyrics
The master returns, there's always some kind of war
And counting his steps, you know it's him at the door
You picture yourself, a star in the furthest sky
Escape from the mess, it's gone when you close your eyes

The master returns, there's always some kind of war
And counting his steps, you know it's him at the door
You picture yourself, a star in the furthest sky
Escape from the mess, it's gone when you close your eyes

Mmhmm
What we need now's an accident
No one to blame and no bullets spent, ha
All we need now's an accident
No one to blame and no bullets spent, oh

Don't know what you got 'til you find it gone
You got an education, yeah
All that we need now's an accident
No one to blame and no bullets spent
All we need now's an accident, uh
I ain't gonna ask what the heavens sent
Don't know what you got 'til you find it gone
You got an education, yeah
Don't know what you got 'til you're 22
Got a mortgage hung around your neck

Mmhmm
Come on, what we need now's an accident
No one to blame and no bullets spent
All we need now's an accident
No one to blame and no bullets spent, oh

No one to blame, no bullets spent
No one to blame, no bullets spent, uh
No one to blame, no bullets spent
No one to blame, no bullets spentEmbed
