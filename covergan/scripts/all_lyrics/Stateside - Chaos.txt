Chaos Lyrics
I need you to love me wild
I need you
To find me in the dark
Sink into these sheets
I like feeling you beneath me
Let me fall apart
I'll do just what you like baby
It's just us tonight
It's just us tonight
It's just us

We'll start a fire
If chaos is what you like
We'll start a fire
We'll burn the city
We'll burn the city just you and I

Can you find me now?
Drowning in the moonlight
Rolling in the deep while we're still
Hiding from the life
Where we don't get to escape for a little while
It's just us tonight
It's just us

We'll start a fire
If chaos is what you like
We'll start a firе
We'll burn the city
We'll burn thе city just you and I
(It's just us tonight)
(It's just us)
We'll start a fire
(It's just us tonight)
(It's just us)
We'll burn the city
We'll burn the city just you and I

(Love me wild)
If chaos is what you like
(Love me wild)
We'll burn the city just
(Love me wild)
Burn the city just
Burn the city just you and I
We'll start a fire
If chaos is what you like
We'll start a fire
We'll burn the city
We'll burn the city just you and I
(It's just us tonight)
(It's just us)
If chaos is what you like
(It's just us tonight)
(It's just us)
Burn the city just you and I

(It's just us tonight)
(Burn them down)
(It's just us)
Burn the city just you and I
(It's just us tonight)
(I need you now)
(It's just us)
Burn the city just you and I
(It's just us tonight)
(Burn the city down)
(It's just us)
Burn the city just you and I
(It's just us tonight)
(If chaos is what you like)
(It's just us)Embed
