Half Gone Lyrics
Well, you had all my love in the palm of your hand
But that wasn't enough and I don't understand why
I gave you all my time, now it's yours; isn't mine, no
'Cause you stole all the love from the palm of my hand

I thought time and some space
Might just heal all this pain
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah

How can I love when my heart's half gone?
There's not enough left for me to move on
Yeah, you took every piece
But the one that I needed was you all along
How can I love when my heart's half gone?

Lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight
And the more I got to know you, the more you would get from me
How could I be so blind? Captivated by those eyes
I lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight

How can I love when my heart's half gone?
There's not enough left for me to move on
Yeah, you took every piece
But the one that I needed was you all along
How can I love when my heart's half gone?
How can I love when my heart's half gone?
I thought time and some space
Might just heal all this pain
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah
I thought time and some space
Might just heal all this pain
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah

How can I love when my heart's half gone?
There's not enough left for me to move on
Yeah, you took every piece
But the one that I needed was you all along
How can I love when my heart's half gone?

(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)
How can I love? Yeah
(When my heart is half gone)
Oh, my heart is half gone
(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)
Oh, you took every piece
And the one that I need is you all along
(When my heart is half gone)
How can I love when my heart's half gone?1Embed
