Watching You Walk Away Lyrics
You know it kills me every time
Watching you walk away
I wake up and you're out the door
Yeah, you leave before, I ask you to stay
You to stay

I say what's up, love?
I can feel the hesitation in between us
Makin' empty conversation, it's a problem
Know we said no expectations, but we got some, we got some

It's like we're always keeping secrets
Yeah, I wonder where you go
Are you with somebody else?
I don't know what ya do alone
Try to play it down but it gets harder to pretend
That I don't care if I see you again

You know it kills me every time
Watching you walk away
I wake up and you're out the door
Yeah, you leave before, I ask you to stay
You to stay
I see it in your eyes
I know it's getting late, yeah
One more night and it's something more
So you leave before I ask you to stay
You know it kills me every time
Why do we only get together after midnight?
Bet that you look even better in the daylight
Know we said don't want no pressure, yeah, it's alright, it's alright

It's like we're always keeping secrets
Yeah, I wonder where you go (Wonder where you go)
Are you with somebody else?
I don't know what ya do alone (Do alone)
Try to play it down but it gets harder to pretend
That I don't care if I see you again

You know it kills me every time
Watching you walk away
I wake up and you're out the door
Yeah, you leave before, I ask you to stay
You to stay
I see it in your eyes
I know it's getting late, yeah
One more night and it's something more
So you leave before I ask you to stay
You know it kills me every time
Yeah, you leave before I ask you to stay
You know it kills me every time
Watching you walk away
I wake up and you're out the door
Yeah, you leave before, I ask you to stay
You know it kills me every time2Embed
