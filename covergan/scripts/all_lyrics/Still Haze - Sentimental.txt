Sentimental Lyrics
Sit here for a minute outside
Breathe like all the drugs that we on
Singing sentimental or worse
Cold to the touch, now it’s no more

On and on the feeling go
Darling why’d I wish too much
Leave me out to dry like the wind though, oh
Darling did I do too much
Wake up every morning like

Did I fuck up, did I say too much
Every whisper spells out your love, oh
Did I fuck up, did I say too much
And I’m feeling every whisper
But there ain’t no rush

Don’t you wrap me around in fables
Don’t you lay me on the table
Don’t you wrap me around in fables
Don’t you lay me on the tablе
Did I fuck up, did I say too much
Yeah I miss you
But there ain’t no rush
Did I fuck up, did I say too much
Yеah I miss you
But there ain’t no rushEmbed
