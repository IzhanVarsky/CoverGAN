The Pressure Lyrics

I'm waiting, I'm holding
Now you set me free
Can't take the pressure you hold over me
I'm falling, I'm fading
I'm losing my mind
Can't take the pressure, I'll leave you behind




I'm waiting, I'm holding
Now you set me free
Can't take the pressure you hold over me
I'm falling, I'm fading
I'm losing my mind
Can't take the pressure, I'll leave you behind
