One (Monster & Infinity) Lyrics
Yeah
Moonshine
 + (All)]
You hear me walk into your town, right? Sounds right
Feel that rumble in the ground, right? Don’t lie
I'm the one (I'm the one), better run (Better run)
If you wit' it (If you wit' it)
Then you're done, done, done (Then you're done)
Dark cloud blocking out the sun (Out the sun)
I ain't scared, got me feeling kind of numb
Yeah, it's a problem, I know
Tell me something I don't know
What you got? I got mo'
[Keep it coming with that reload
Ain't no stopping me, though
I go and I lose control] (Woo)

고갤 들어, hear it talking to me in my body
From the shadow waking up, up, up
Bring the battle, give me what I want (Alright)

No games, watch me deliver every time
Catch me in the latest, driving spaceships
One way, we going up, ain't no decline
Landing in the matrix, tryna break it
Hands up, 나를 느껴봐, yeah
All the way to infinity, yeah
높게, we going up, there's no decline
So if you're aiming anywhere, aim high, 'igh, 'igh
날려, make 'em drop, yeah (One)
Not enough, level up
You wanna see how I get down like, yeah, right
우리 움직임은 거대한 그 하나
Break you with that left, with that right
Make you feel the fire
You ain't got the moves or the fuel
That's the bottom line
Think you're ready for the monster, monster?
No turning back if you wanna face me, no (Woo)

Tried to warn ya' we was coming in
Got no time for all this arguin', oh, no
It's way beyond control (Beyond control)
고갤 들어, hear it talking to me in my body
From the shadow waking up, up, up
Bring the battle, give me what I want (Alright)

No games, watch me deliver every time
Catch me in the latest, driving spaceships
One way, we going up, ain't no decline
Landing in the matrix, tryna break it
Hands up, 나를 느껴봐, yeah (느껴봐, yeah)
All the way to infinity, yeah (Oh, oh, ooh)
높게, we going up, there's no decline
So if you're aiming anywhere, aim high, 'igh, 'igh
너와 내가 하나 된 세상에
I'll never stop, no, I'm not playing no games
Face to face and don't run away
Think you're ready for the monster, monster?
Never seen a mountain too big for me
I'm gon' be alright, got forever on my mind
No pressure but we pressin', so you better run
We bring another dawn, we've only just begun (No games)

No games, watch me deliver every time
Catch me in the latest, driving spaceships (Yeah)
One way (Yeah), we going up, ain't no decline (Yeah)
Landing in the matrix, tryna break it (No games)
Hands up, 나를 느껴봐, yeah
All the way to infinity, yeah
높게, we going up, there's no decline
So if you're aiming anywhere, aim high, 'igh, 'igh

I'm the other one, chilling with them other ones
O-O-Other one
I'm the other one, chilling with them other ones
Yeah, other ones3Embed
