Low Lyrics
Oh, this world is way too much for me
Try to run but keep on stumbling
Try to talk but keep on mumbling
Do you ever feel that way?

Ohh
Yeah, I been feelin' low
Ohh
Yeah, I been feelin' low

Oh this world is way too cold for me
And this coat won't fix this over freeze
Lord, I know I pray on broken knees
Will I ever be okay?

Ohh
Yeah, I been feelin' low
Ohh
Yeah, I been feelin' low

I'm findin' peace in a pocket full of memories
Findin' love in a head full of melodies
Why won't you listen when I say it's all that's left of me?
My mama's recipes, my only remedies
I can't fake what I'm dreaming of
Seems like hell's freezing over, love
This feel fits me like a broken glove
Can't you hear me from up above?
Ohh
Yeah, I been feelin' low
Ohh
Yeah, I been feelin' low2Embed
