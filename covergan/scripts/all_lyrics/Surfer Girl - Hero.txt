Hero LyricsIf you’re really bout peace and love
Grab your lighters and put them up and say:
“our president don’t know shit”
There’s no captain to steer the ship
If you’ve really got heart and soul
And you’re sick and tired of this storm just say:
“our president don’t know shit”
The change come from within
Humans losing focus
Brains is on the islands
Is the television broken
How come nobody is smiling?
Thunderstorms and locusts
Lets not resort to violence
Jewelry stores are closing
But the pressures forming diamonds
It’s a tough pill to swallow
Tough act to follow
I sip and I sip til that shit go hollow
The oracle Apollo
Has seen tomorrow
Believe it or not all we need is a hero
The coppers are out, man they’re back on patrol
They’re harassing some people, and letting some go
We say this is crazy but have no control so we
Smoking that shit that get you on the floor
We celebrate differences but look inside
I am the same as every other guy
Money is power, but dasshity blind
The system is broken let’s open our mind
Lack of concentration
Captive of devices
Hard to stay afloat with rising tides and rising prices
When A first world nation
Has an identity crisis
We have to come together but you’d rather be divisive
We were on the straight and narrow
Now it’s bow and arrows
Dipped in gold, you think you hold the title of the pharaoh
Caligula and Nero
Compassion levels zero
Put our hands up, all we need is a heroEmbed
