Here On My Own Lyrics
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
Here on my o-
I'm
I'm
Here on my o-
I'm

I'm here on my own
I'm here on my own
I'm here on my own
I'm here on my own

Aside from all the leaves that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the dreams that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the leaves that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the dreams that surround us
I'm just here on my own
I'm here on my own (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm here on my own (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm here on my own (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm here on my own

Aside from all the leaves that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the dreams that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the leaves that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the dreams that surround us
I'm just here on my own

I'm
I'm
I'm
Here on my o-
I'm
I'm
Here on my o-
I'm
I'm here on my own
I'm here on my own
I'm here on my own
I'm here on my own


I'm
Here on my o-
I'm
I'm
Here on my o-
I'm

I'm here on my own (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm here on my own (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm here on my own (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm here on my own

Aside from all the leaves that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the dreams that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the leaves that surround us
I'm just here on my own
Aside from all the dreams that surround us
I'm just here on my own
