Donâ€™t You Worry Child Lyrics
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
