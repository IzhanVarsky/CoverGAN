Unreal LyricsI cannot believe you're real
And I wonder why  in this world
Yeah, this is how I feel
Sometimes it feels like I'm chasing after ghosts
Oh yes, it's you
Oh yes, it's you
Oh yes, it's you
Oh yes, it's you
Oh yes, it's you
I cannot believe you're real
And I wonder why  in this world
Yeah, this is how I feel
Sometimes it feels like I'm chasing after ghosts
Oh yes, it's you
(Oh yes, it's you)
(Oh yes, it's you)
Oh yes, it's you
Yeah, this is how I feel
Sometimes it feels like I'm chasing after ghosts
Oh yes, it's you
Oh yes, it's you
Oh yes, it's youEmbed
