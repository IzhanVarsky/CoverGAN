Mystik Lyrics
Voodoo truth
Why don't you tie the noose
Run circles through the senses wave
Rhythm healer is your false defeater
Lock me inside of your cage
And turn the lights down slowly
You don't even know me
Come closer to the knife
I'm seeking the truth within
My heart was filled with sin
Oh I learn about your sacrifice

There's a natural mystik in the air
And darling, you were looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you real and do you feel, and are you really there?
And there's a natural mystik in the air
And darling, you were looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you real and do you feel, and are you really there?
Ah, ah, yeah

Hoodoo guru now I ask for your direction, please
Put your hands up in the air where I can see them
You see I suffocate myself at night, drowning in my dreamin'
No, I forgot my peace when I knew it was there
Lonesome wandering soul walked the earth, my heart was bare
I kissed the ground, no I was never found
I guess I laid my ego to rest
And there's a natural mystik in the air
And darling, you were looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you real and do you feel, and are you really there?
And there's a natural mystik in the air
And darling, you were looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you real and do you feel, and are you really there?
Ah, ah, yeah6Embed
