Pump Up the Jam Lyrics
Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that

I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Yo! Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that

I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my, make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my, make my make my day
Yo! Pump up the jam
Pump it up
Pump it up
Yo! Pump it!
Pump up the jam
Pump it up
Pump it up
Yo! Pump it
Pump up the jam
Pump it up
Pump it up
Yo! Pump it
Pump up the jam

Pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Pump it up
Pump it
Pump it

Pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Pump it
Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look at here the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, cause that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad

I want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Pump up the jam
