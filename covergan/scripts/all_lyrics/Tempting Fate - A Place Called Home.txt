A Place Called Home LyricsLooking back at the light I thought I knew so well
Overthought it all since I was 12 years old
Scared to swing for defense so regret would follow
What a hard pill to swallow
I take back everything I said when the world was not my friend
(Getting high in my room every weekend)
I take back everything I said when the world was not my friend
(When the world was not my friend)
I've waited for so long
To feel like I belong
A place that I call home
Where I don't sleep alone
I've waited for so long
To feel like I belong
A place that I call home
Where I don't sleep alone
(Where I don't sleep alone) Now the memories fade, turning into stone
Hard to break the mold and bet it in my bones
Swinging for defense so regret won't follow
Cause that's a tough pill to swallow
I take back everything I said when the world was not my friend
(I quit, I've had enough of this)
I take back everything I said when the world was not my friend
(I quit, I've had enough of this)
I've waited for so long
To feel like I belong
A place that I call home
Where I don't sleep alone
I've waited for so long
To feel like I belong
A place that I call home
Where I don't sleep alone
(Where I don't sleep alone)
From birth to death I thought I _______
So I justify what life signifies
From birth to death I thought I _______
You'll never break me down
You'll never break me down
I've waited for so long
I've waited for so long
To feel like I belong
A place that I call home
Where I don't sleep alone
I've waited for so long
To feel like I belong
A place that I call home
Where I don't sleep alone
(Where I don't sleep alone)
I'm searching for a place that I call home
Where I don't sleep aloneEmbed
