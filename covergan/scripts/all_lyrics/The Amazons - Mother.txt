Mother Lyrics
Friends wanna kill me
But I give them all my loving anyway
If God won't forgive me
I'm not the only one to make amends

Mother, it's not in my hands
Try to understand it's only 'cause I can
Fools believe they can erase
All that they've done wrong
But I don't wanna be that son
Mother
Mother

Cheats try to judge me
But I can see the sins that stain your smile
Friends say I gotta see reason
But I'm crawling out of the ceiling
I'm tired of bowing to preachers all the time

Mother, it's not in my hands
Try to understand it's only 'cause I can
Fools believe they can erase
All that they've done wrong
But I don't wanna be that son
Mother
Mother
Friends say I gotta see reason
I'm crawling out of the ceiling
I'm tired of bowing to preachers
Can't find something to believe in
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Mother, it's not in my hands
Try to understand it's only 'cause I can
Fools believe they can erase
All that they've done wrong
But I don't wanna be that son
Mother
