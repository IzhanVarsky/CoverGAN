Victory Lyrics
I don't write 'cause I don't think
I don't have a need to speak
I don't see the bright side, quite as clear
Accolades and happy days
They don't ever last
Stories of courage clouded up with fear

In the broom grass I would l lie
Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me
From Victory, I tried
To match eternal light with how I lead my life
Of course, I was forced to retreat
From victory I accept defeat

Waxy green and yellow walls
Outside my windows fall
Covering the light I thought I'd see
Am I sad or am I sick?
What's at the root of it?
Do I throw my hands and quit?
Something tells me no

In the broom grass I would l lie
Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me
From victory, I tried
To match eternal light with how I lead my life
Of course, I was forced to retreat
From victory I accept defeat
Worries on all sides of my mind
In silence, my darkness is denied

In the broom grass I would l lie
Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me
From victory, I tried
To match eternal light with how I lead my life
Of course, I was forced to retreat
From victory I accept defeat
From victory I accept defeatEmbed
