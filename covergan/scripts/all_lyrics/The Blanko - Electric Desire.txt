Electric Desire LyricsYou are my queen, the killer machine
You're ruling the moment that everyone tries to seize
So very strong, above and beyond
The light of your soul demands and the world responds
You're my electric desire
With you I can always go higher
Right now, this is us, this is power
Together we're taking what's ours
You're my electric desire
With you I can always go higher
I feel you loud without a sound
The light in the darkness, the voice from th–µ undergroung
We live to win, got nothing to lose
Our pure domination will not be misunderstood
You're my electric desire
With you I can always go higher
Right now, this is us, this is power
Together we're taking what's ours
You're my electric desire
With you I can always go higherEmbed
