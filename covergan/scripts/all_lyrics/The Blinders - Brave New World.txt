Brave New World Lyrics
Forgotten teachings, the son of a sin
In come, The Idiot King
He build a wall, and he built it high
But did you know that it's made out of pie?

The year of Ford 1939
The TV culture in hyperdrive
The Kardashians on a wild acid trip
The brave new world takes its first sip

Oh to be, from the land of the free
Oh to be, from the land of the free
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world

The fog moves and I'm struggling to think
My eyes in my brain
And my head's in the sink
A light happening where it doesn't exist
To the jungle bar, babe
It's a trip
Oh to be, from the land of the free
Oh to be, from the land of the free
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world
Oh to be, from the land of the free
Oh to be, from the land of the free

Marching men with bewitched eyes
Heads now working in disguise
Feet keep marching towards your demise
Hear the sound of dystopian cries

Watch them build it from the floor
Watch them take it from the poor
Watch them change a dozen laws
Watch them snatch it from us all
From us all
From us all
From us all
From us all
From us all
From us all
From us all
From us allEmbed
