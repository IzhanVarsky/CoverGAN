Hello Lyrics
Walking down the street with some evil in my eye
And some thoughts in my head that were making me feel high
On my head was a hoodie, in my ears was some bass
I was walking by my dog when I saw that sexy face
Come towards me, with a little cheeky smile
If she was a phone, I'd pick her up and dial
The fire brigade, or zero-zero-zero
She stopped me in my tracks and I said

Mm, hello, hello
Whoa, hello, hello

I was sleeping in the sand with some dreams in my head
That were causing an extension to the towel and my bed
And the waves were a-rolling like the curves on those legs
Of the sweet beach bella with that centrefold spread
In the midst of the slumber, I heard some footsteps creeping
And I woke to discover the woman I'd been dreaming
She knelt down beside, said, "Can I share your pillow?"
I rolled over and I said

Well, hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello
Some like money making, some like cars
And some like the houses with the rooftop spas
And some like to gossip about some rich sugar daddies
But me and my friends, we like the golden brown honeys
And some like watching people living on TV
That's a little strange if you're asking me
'Cause I like to eat and laugh and fuck and play down low
These are the things I know

Well, hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello
Ah, hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello

Welcome to this night, welcome to this song
Welcome to these rhymes that be going on and on
Welcome to the empire and the funky empire tunes
But most of all, welcome to the bellas in this room
Welcome to this night, welcome to this song
Welcome to these rhymes that be going on and on
Welcome to the empire and the funky empire tunes
But most of all, welcome to the bellas in this room
Hello, hello
Whoa, hello, hello
Whoa, hello, hello
Pablo, Pablo
Whoa, hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello
Well, hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello

Hello, hello3Embed
