Wolves LyricsWell the ghosts by my side
Sing Staying Alive
I didn't come here tonight
To get cornered and tired
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
Slit the moon with a knife
Step into the night
You got a look in your eye
You could light up the sky
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves

And maybe one day we'll all stand still
And watch the sun fall down over that hill
Where no light can ever return
But baby til then I'll watch the world turn
All the drums in a line
They sparkle and shine
Like cut diamond time
Like gunshots in signs
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
And maybe one day we'll all stand still
And watch the sun fall down over that hill
Where no light can ever return
But baby til then I'll watch the world turn
Well the ghosts by my side
Sing Staying Alive
I didn't come here tonight
To get cornered and tired
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves
We're going to run like wolves

And maybe one day we'll all stand still
And watch the sun fall down over that hill
Where no light can ever return
But baby til then
I'll watch the world turn
Watch the world turn
Watch the world turn
Watch the world turn
Watch the world turn
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolves
Going to run like wolvesEmbed
