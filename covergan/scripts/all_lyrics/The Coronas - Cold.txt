Cold Lyrics
I'm cold but I will not show it
I'm too proud and the night won't allow
No the night won't allow
A cold chill on my shoulder
It's not too loud
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold

When I go I won't like you less
Though it seems I'm still streets ahead
It wasn't a fake, it wasn't a lie
Just a bit unkind
Think of me when you feel ok
Or give me a reason to see you anyway
We never got to say goodbye
It came as some surprise

How do we know?
Do we trust ourselves that much?
How do we know?

I'm cold but I will not show it
I'm too proud and the night won't allow
No the night won't allow
A cold, it's not too loud
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold
I can't pretend that I planned it out
Just witnessed the words falling right out of my mouth
I didn't think, I just talked I couldn't turn it off
You look at me the way I want to be seen
I never told you enough what that means
Even our friends are more than amazed
They don't know what to say

How do we know?
Do we trust ourselves that much?
How do we know?

I'm cold but I will not show it
I'm too proud and the night won't allow
No the night won't allow
A cold, it's not too loud
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold...

Gimme a reason to see you anyway
Gimme a reason to feel ok
Gimme a reason to see you anyway
I'm too proud
And the night won't allow
No the night won't allowEmbed
