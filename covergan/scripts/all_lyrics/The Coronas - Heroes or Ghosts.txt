Heroes or ghosts Lyrics
So here we go
Heroes or ghosts
One man's mood can break another man's soul
Or am I just too cynical for my own good
Am I too scared to say, we'll get there if we should

And you know, you know
It's harder than it looks, it's harder than it looks
But I, I know, it's gonna take a lot of time and a little bit of luck

But it's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
I've seen a reaction, yeah I've watched us improve
And you could say we don't care or that we don't believe
But this is what we've got
And there's nowhere we'd rather be

And you know these roads, they could take us to the start
From the shadows you've cast to play the part
So don't grow old, forgetting who you are
A simple goal could get you very far

And you know, oh yeah, you know
That it's harder than it looks, it's harder than it looks
But I, I know, it's gonna take a lot of time and a little bit of luck
But it's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
I've seen a reaction, yeah I've watched us improve
And you could say we don't care or that we don't believe
But this is what we've got and there's nowhere

It's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
I've seen a reaction, now we've so much to prove
And you could say we don't care or that we don't believe
But this is what we've got and there's nowhere we'd rather be
There's nowhere we'd rather be


So here we go
Heroes or ghosts
One man's mood can break another man's soul
Or am I just too cynical for my own good
Am I too scared to say, we'll get there if we should
We'll get there if we shouldEmbed
