LA at Night Lyrics
Are you still mad?
Let's dance around that
Keep it breezy
Well I'm so glad
It's not a fake laugh
It's just easy

And who wants to fall in love
All the cynics stand up
And we'll both lie down right here on this floor
It never seems to be enough
You couldn't make this shit up
Looks like it's one of those things that just can't be ignored

So take me to your favourite place nearby
I've never seen LA before at night from this high
Both careful cause we're hurting from past mistakes
But I think we're almost certain yeah we're gonna be ok

And if it's too soon
Then we're both screwed just on purpose
And it's a big if
Just like my card tricks
They're not perfect
And who wants to fall in love
All the cynics stand up
And we'll both lie down right here on this floor
It never seems to be enough
You couldn't make this shit up
Looks like it's one of those things that just can't be ignored

So take me to your favourite place nearby
I've never seen LA before at night from this high
Both careful cause we're hurting from past mistakes
But I think we're almost certain yeah we're gonna be ok

And I nearly just said something there it might be too soon
Look at us we're nervous now but it feels kinda cool
Don't talk about the future or past mistakes
We're careful but we're open yeah we're gonna be okay
It's gonna be ok
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

Did you find it all a little too hard?
It's gonna be ok
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ahEmbed
