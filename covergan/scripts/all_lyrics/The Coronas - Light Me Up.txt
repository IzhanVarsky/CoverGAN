Light Me Up Lyrics
Have you had enough?
Cause we're losing all the things that made us good
But I’d never deceive no I’d never deceive you love
At least we agree to disagree on that ah

Am I freaking out?
Cause I'm screaming all these things inside my mouth
I wanna believe yeah I wanna believe them now
We don't have to say if we're having a good time

You tell me I made it, but I'm feeling kinda strange
Can I get a reaction, gimme something I can say
And if I could just find it
I think it's somewhere in my flaws
You don't mind it though, you just light me up

Or can I press restart?
How could I ever miss the changing of your heart
Well I don't wanna believe I don't wanna believe I would
Remember when you said we'd never fall apart ah

Am I just scared?
That I'll never be as strong without you there
That everything we built has gone beyond repair
But I'd never give up no I'd never give up on us oh
You tell me I made it, but I'm feeling kinda strange
Can I get a reaction, gimme me something I can say
And if I could just find it
I think it's somewhere in my flaws
You don't mind it though, you just light me up

You don't mind it though, you just light me up
You never tried to cut me off
You always liked the way I talked
You don't mind it though, you just light me up
Was it something that you saw
I think it's somewhere in my flaws

You tell me I made it, but I'm feeling kinda strange
Can I get a reaction, gimme me something I can say
And if I could just find it
I think it's somewhere in my flaws
No you wouldn't have minded
No you wouldn't have minded

You tell me I made it, but I'm feeling kinda strange
Can I get a reaction, gimme me something I can say
And if I could just find it
I think it's somewhere in my flaws
You don't mind it though, you just light me upEmbed
