Lost in the Thick of It Lyrics
I didn't need it, I said enough
The way you walked away, it really messed me up
I tried to salvage, left it alone
Won't make it better I could never do it all

I'm good for a little bit, but I
Get lost in the thick of it
I hate to say that I'm wrong
Feels better playing along
Hoping you don't notice it when I'm
Just a bit low-spirited, I gotta face it alone

Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
Do do do duh

There must be nothing you've left to prove
Turn it into something that you never wanna lose
I want a lawyer, give me a good lawyer too
I'll say I'm guilty if it brings me back to you
I'm good for a little bit, but I
Get lost in the thick of it, sometimes
I hate to say that I'm wrong
Feels better playing along
Hoping you don't notice it when I'm
Just a bit low-spirited, and I, I gotta face it alone

Maybe we could meet up sometime
Just a little knees-up sometime
Walk until our feet hurt sometime
'Cause we're only growing, not unfolding (Sometime)
We used to be addicted one time
We couldn't even fake it one time
I guess that's when we drifted you're right
And I hope you know it's never over

I'm good for a little bit, but I
Get lost in the thick of it sometimes
I hate to say that I'm wrong
Feels better playing along
Hoping you don't notice it when I'm
Just a bit low-spirited, and I
I've gotta face it alone
I'm good for a little bit (Just a bit low spirited)
I hate to say that I'm wrong
Feels better playing along
Hoping you don't notice it (Just a bit low spirited)
I've gotta face it alone

Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
Do do do duhEmbed
