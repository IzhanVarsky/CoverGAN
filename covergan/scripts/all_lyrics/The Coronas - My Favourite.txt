My Favourite Lyrics
Remind me again why we keep coming here
Music's too loud I can barely hear you
Get your attention, you already know
Say your goodbyes, tell 'em you're tired oh

You're my favourite
And I'm not able

Why didn't you tell us your mind?
Did you even know?
I guess I'm jealous a lot
How could you not know?
Why didn't you tell us your mind?
Did you even know?
Well I guess I'm jealous a lot
How could you not know?

What's that? I'm not making sense
I forced things to their detriment
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
Twice now I said I've had enough
As I watched you somehow sеlf-destruct
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
You'rе still my favourite
And I'm not able

Why didn't you tell us your mind?
Did you even know?
Well I guess I'm jealous a lot
How could you not know?

Twice now I said I've had enough
As I watched you somehow self-destruct
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
What's that? You're not making sense
I force things even to their end
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)

But the world made me afraid of
'Cause I warned myself that these things might come up
(Don't try to change it)
I think we've been through enough
(Don't try to change it)
I suppose we got to take it
Now at least we found a good excuse to love
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
To love
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
You're still my favourite
And I'm not able

Why didn't you tell us your mind?
Did you even know?
I guess I'm jealous a lot
How could you not know?Embed
