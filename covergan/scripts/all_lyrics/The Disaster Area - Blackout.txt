Blackout Lyrics
You let the blackout take me

I walk with the dead but I feel the souls
Crawl into my heart and they keep it cold
I never wanted to live (Live) forever
Now you are the pressure holding me together
I never wanted to live forever

You let the blackout take me

Right to where you are
But I blacked out all my memories
I don't care how far
You have to go to erasе me
(To erase mе)

Drive in all the nails when the coffins close
Let me take the fall for another ghost
I never wanted to live (Live) forever
(To erase me forever)
(To erase me)
Right to where you are
But I blacked out all my memories
I don't care how far
You have to go to erase me

Well, you can fucking try
(To erase me)
Abandoned me, left all on my own again
A fall from grace
I'll always remember what you did
(To erase me)
But I blacked out all the memories

You let the blackout take me

Right to where you are
But I blacked out all my memories
I don't care how far
You have to go to erase me
Right to where you are
But I blacked out all my memories
I don't care how far
You have to go to erase me
(To erase me)Embed
