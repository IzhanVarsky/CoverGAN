Glasshearts Lyrics
When it’s dark it’s easier to see
The light to lead us through this misery

Hard not to walk away and put it all to rest
When no one ever seems to care or seems to give a shit

Did you get what you needed?
You took everything we believed in
Gave you an inch and you took a mile
We know the truth but you’re in denial
We are the misled generation
We are the glasshearts

And I spent to long finding where I belong
I couldn’t see that I was lost

Hard not to walk away and put it all to bed
Go back on what you say and be a hypocrite

Did you get what you needed?
You took everything we believed in
Gave you an inch and you took a mile
We know the truth but you’re in denial
We are the misled generation
We are the glasshearts
I’m talking to ghosts but I’m still speaking too fast
Wouldn’t you like to know if they’re talking to me back?
I’m talking to ghosts but I’m still speaking too fast
Wouldn’t you like to know if they’re talking to me back?
I’m talking to ghosts and they don’t know what they have
Wouldn’t you like to know if I’ll be taking it back?

Did you get what you needed?
You took everything we believed in
Gave you an inch and you took a mile
We know the truth but you’re in denial
We are the misled generation

Gave you an inch and you took a mile
We know the truth but you’re in denial
We are the misled generation
We are the glasshearts
I’m talking to ghosts but I’m still speaking too fast
Wouldn’t you like to know if I’ll be taking it back?Embed
