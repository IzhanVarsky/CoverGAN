Get Hurt Lyrics
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
Sometimes I dream some more
I keep my wounds without a bandage
Baby, as I come stumblin' through the door
Spent my nights in dislocation
Talking to spirits on the floor
I think I came to find the feeling, baby
Between what was mine and what was yours

And I came to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me, yeah
Have you come here to get her?
Have you come to take her away from me?
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

I think I'm gonna move to California
(I think it's time to move)
Momma, can you say a prayer for me?
(Say a prayer for me)
I heard they don't get so low-down
(All my friends get so low-down)
I heard they never bleed
Not like we bleed
And I came to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me, yeah
Have you come here to get her?
Have you come to take her away from me?
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And it gets pretty late and the stations will change
And the things once in order now seem so strange
Once I could tell all the hurt apart from myself
Now all I can see is the need, the need

And I came to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me, yeah
Have you come here to get her?
Have you come to take her away from me?
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And maybe you needed a change or maybe I was in the way
Maybe some things they stay and some things go away
And maybe I was mine and maybe you were not the same9Embed
