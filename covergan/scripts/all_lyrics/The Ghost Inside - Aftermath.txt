Aftermath Lyrics
Running around in circles
And I'm heading nowhere fast
Because more was said in silence
Than I could ever say in this song
So how many times
(How many times)
So how many times must I beat my head against a wall
Before I finally break through?

Is this where it ends?
Can I be myself ever again?
The sights and sounds, the rise and the fall
It all played out with my life on pause
This is where it ends
I will not stay silent ever again
The sights and sounds, the rise and the fall
I'll find my way after all

I don't have it in me to sing of defeat
Triumph over tragedy

For all the demons that follow me around
It's time I put you six feet deep underground
It's time to put you six feet deep underground
Is this where it ends?
Can I be myself ever again?
The sights and sounds, the rise and the fall
It all played out with my life on pause
This is where it ends
I will not stay silent ever again
The sights and sounds, the rise and the fall
I'll find my way after all

The beat goes on
Yeah, and the beat goes on

Foundations that could never break
Was moving forward a mistake?
Or is that me pretending?
What happened to my happy ending?
Foundations that could never break
Was moving forward a mistake?
Or is that me pretending?
What happened to my happy ending?
Today I woke up to a brand new me
I know I can't rewrite history
Yesterday is gone
And I'm ready for what tomorrow brings
(Foundations that could never break
Was moving forward a mistake?
Or is that me pretending?
What happened to my happy ending?)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on
Yesterday is gone
But the beat goes on
(Foundations that could never break
Was moving forward a mistake?
Or is that me pretending?
What happened to my happy ending?)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on
Yesterday is gone
But the beat goes on2Embed
