By the Grace of God LyricsHey girl
You'll land it
You've got supplies
If they demand it
You've got the looks
And the glamour
Cut by the chisel
And beat by the hammer
They're naive
So they'll believe it
They will act like dogs
When they recieve it
Through the darkness
And the haze
A straight and narrow
Fall from grace
They need - they yearn
They lust with cheeks unturned
Hands shake and heads will nod
They get by by the grace of god
Hey boy
You understand
Say your prayers
Or you'll be damned
He's a watcher
And a voyer
Bystander
And destroyer
They need - they yearn
They lust with cheeks unturned
Hands shake and heads will nod
They get by by the grace of god
Yeah, they get by
They need - they yearn
They lust with cheeks unturned
Hands shake and heads will nod
They get by by the grace of god
Yeah, they get by, by the grace of God
We get by, we get by, by the grace of GodEmbed
