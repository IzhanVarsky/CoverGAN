Heavy Hearted Lyrics
Ooh-ooh!

Have I ever turned you on?
Have I ever done you wrong?
Have I set your mind at ease?
Well, let me know
Have I ever made you smile?
Oh, for even just a while
Did I play or did I tease?
Oh, let me know

'Cause I, 'cause I love you so
And I need to know
If there's something wrong

Oh, baby, you're so
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Back when it was only you and me
Now we're apart
Tell me why, baby, you're so
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Back when it was only you and me
'Cause now we're apart
When I come off too strong
I look kinda crazy
Oh, please don't get me wrong
Oh, no
And girl, if it feels right
Any day or night
You can hit me on my line
Any time

'Cause I, 'cause I love you so
And I need to know
If there's something wrong

Oh, baby, you're so
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Back when it was only you and me
Now we're apart
Tell me why, baby, you're so
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Back when it was only you and me
'Cause now we're apart

'Cause I love you so
And I need to know
If there's something wrong
Oh, baby, you're so
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Back when it was only you and me
Now we're apart
Tell me why, baby, you're so
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Back when it was only you and me
'Cause now we're apart
Oh

Tell me why, baby, you're so2Embed
