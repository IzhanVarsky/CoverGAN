Days Like This Lyrics
I knew there would be days like this
I knew it but I took the risk
Take the cuffs off of my wrist
On the edge of the precipice

Maybe we're better off
But I don't wanna believe it
There was a storm that we couldn't stop
And now we're stuck in the grieving

I've been watching, the sunrise and fighting
Sleep deprived, and I've been running
Never let it catch me
And maybe I won't dream of you

I knew there would be days like this
I knew it but I took the risk
I knew there would be days like this
Oh I knew there would be days like this
I knew there would be days like this
I knew it but I took the risk
To take the cuffs off of my wrist
On the edge of the precipice
Now you saying we shouldn't talk
Just wanna know what you're thinking
I know it's late and I shouldn't call
When i don't have a reason

I've been watching, the sunrise and fighting
Sleep deprived, and I've been running
Never let it catch me
And maybe I won't dream of you

I knew there would be days like this
I knew it but I took the risk
I knew there would be days like this
Oh I knew there would be days like this
I knew there would be days like this
I knew it but I took the risk
To take the cuffs off of my wrist
On the edge of the precipice
There would be days like, days like
I knew there would be days like this
There would be days like, days like this
I knew there would be days like this
Days like, days like this
I knew there would be days like this
I knew there would be days like this
I knew it but I took the risk
Take the cuffs off of my wrist
On the edge of the precipiceEmbed
