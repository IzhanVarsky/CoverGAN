Do What You Want Lyrics
Hey do what you want, but don't do it around me
Idleness and dissipation breed apathy
I sit on my ass all goddamn day
A misanthropic anthropoid with nothing to

Say what you must, do all you can
Break all the fucking rules and
Go to Hell with Superman and
Die like a champion, yeah hey!

Hey I don't know if the billions will survive
But I'll believe in God when one and one are five
My moniker is man and I'm rotten to the core
I'll tear down the building just to pass through the door
