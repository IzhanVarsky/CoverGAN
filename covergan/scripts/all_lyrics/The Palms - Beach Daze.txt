Beach Daze LyricsWell I'm just a fool
And no one's right
Taking my own
Baby tonight
Beach daze on weekdays
Floating into outer space
If only, they told me
Now I'm turning my time into gold
I'm in love with a shade of grey
Got my sleeves rolled up
You know it's just a phase
Now the crowds are gone
But the voices say
Oh happiness
Won't you come my way
Beach daze on weekdays
Floating into outer space
If only, they told me
Now I'm turning my time into gold
Remember how a song
When it used to come on
And it'd take you to another place
Baby that's all I want
That's all I want
I'm struggling to believe
And it's there for all my friends to see
When it really shouldn't matter to me
But I'm only human
I just want to say
There'll be better days
Build my castle back up
To watch it wash away
If we're gonna fall out
Know forever there'll be
Beach daze on weekdays
Floating into outer space
If only, they told me
Now I'm turning my time into gold
Beach daze
Imagine time as a currency
Would you spend it on things that don't make you happy?
In this moment realize
You make the differenceEmbed
