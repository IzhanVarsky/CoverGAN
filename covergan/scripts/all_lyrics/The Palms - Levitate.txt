Levitate Lyrics
One shot and I'm holdin', but I don't care 'cuz I'm golden
Woke up Sunday morning with a song stuck in my head
Seein' things right before me
Used to own me, but that's the old me
And "give it up" was the best thing that they said

We almost had it all
Once again, all bets say, they won't make it
Some day we'll have this thing figured out
'Til then, better go an' tell 'em
Better go an' tell 'em

We're gonna celebrate
So watch me here as I levitate
Gonna celebrate
So watch me here as I levitate

3 o'clock in the mornin'
Under the moonlight, another moment
Stretched out in the centerfold that I can't get out of my head
All these thing that they told me, used to mold me
But that's the old me
We're going straight to the stars 'cuz that's who we are
We almost had it all
Once again, all bets say, they won't make it
Some day we'll have this thing figured out
'Til then, better go an' tell 'em
Better go an' tell 'em

We're gonna celebrate
So watch me as I levitate
(Let's take this way too far)
We don't discriminate
(No matter who you are)
So watch me as I levitate

We're gonna celebrate
(Let's take this way too far)
Gonna celebrate
(No matter who you are)
So watch me as I levitate
(We're going past the stars)
We don't discriminate
(We'll take you past the stars)
So watch me as I levitateEmbed
