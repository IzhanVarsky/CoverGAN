Lolaâ€™s Theme LyricsOooooh yeah

Looking back
I know I was walking around in disguise
It's a fact
I was just a lost soul, I needed a guide

And the moment that you came to change my life
(Looking back together, yeah)
Oh, you fired up my heart and made me smile
Coz' you and I know that

I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around

Fears I had
All fading away by a minute and I
Feel alive
You have twisted all of my troubles inside
Like a little piece of heaven finally found
(Looking back together, yeah)
You've refilled my heart up from the ground
Coz' you and I know, baby

I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
(Oh yeah, yeah)
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
(Turn my world around)
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around
(Oh yeah, yeah)
(I'm-I'm-I'm)
(I'm-I'm-I'm)
Oh, you fired up my heart and made me smile
And you and I know baby!
Turn my world around!
Oh yeah, yeah
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
(Turn my world around)
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around1Embed
