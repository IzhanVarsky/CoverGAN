Cyr Lyrics
Fragments form the mind
Shadows hold the mist
Fractured as this wish
Shattered I resign
We're on the verge, we're on the verge
Of sacred dawning and sloe-sloe eyes

Say, I done told you
Say how I tried too
Where you've wrought
From creation's crown
Say, dire warning
Stare down your masters
With the promise of (With the promise of)
One and what you are
We're on the verge

Tangеnts vex the whorl
The void arrivеs then leaves
Returning, returning a kiss
For lovers built the dream

Say, I done told you
Say how I tried too
Where you've wrought
From creation's crown
Say, dire warning
Stare down your masters
With the promise of (With the promise of )
One and what you are
We're on the verge
Did the times, wind
Did the crowd, kind
Aping youth, wise
Ever lost, ides
'Midst the chaff, as meek
And those weak, as sand
Turning glass upside down
For the hours should they pass

Say, I done told you
Say how I tried too
Where you've wrought
(Where you've wrought, where you've wrought)
From creation's crown
We're on the verge
Say, dire warning
Stare down your masters
With the promise of (With the promise of)
One and what you are
(What you are, what you are, we're on the verge)
We're on the verge

(We're on the verge)
We're on the verge
We're on the vergeEmbed
