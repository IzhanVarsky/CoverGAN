Fly On The Wall LyricsI got a secret, come and take a look inside it with me
I got a secret, gotta tell someone, come share it with me
I can't keep it all locked up inside of me
It’s like the secret's seeping through my defense coming to me
I'm burning up about it, come and step inside it with me
I got a secret and I gotta fucking tell somebody
I got a secret but the way it makes me feel...
Feel...
What if it makes you feel more alone than
You’ve ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Your heart can't take it?
What if it makes you feel more alone than
You've ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Your heart can't take it?
Would you tell it now?
Would you tell it... now?
The more I think about it, I can't even vouch for me
I never heard it, so I thought my mind was playing again
I play the victim, get defensive just rememberin' it
I got a secret, come and take a look inside it with me
I got a secret, gotta do something, come share it with me
I got a secret and I gotta fucking tell somebody
I’m burning up about the way it makes me feel...
Feel...
What if it makes you feel more alone than
You’ve ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Your heart can’t take it?
What if it makes you feel more alone than
You've ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Your heart can't take it?
Now...
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
Now...
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
Now...
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
What if it makes you feel more alone than
You’ve ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Your heart can't take it?
What if it makes you feel more alone than
You've ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Your heart can't take it?
Now...
How is this make you feeling?
How is this make you feeling?
Now...
How is this make you feeling?
And would you tell it now?
Would you tell it... now?Embed
