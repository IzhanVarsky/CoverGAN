Smile Like A Hostage Lyrics
You'd better make amends
With your loyal believers
Dependent on your skills
I'd like to take this time to thank you all
You patronize yourself
And your words never matter
Only thinking of yourself
I've done so much and think of only you

So smile like a hostage
We hate to watch you
Staking your claim
As to better suit you
So we'll just smile and say
Thanks so much
You're too much
Thanks so much
And smile like a hostage

Now we're throwing stones
Behind the glass in the shadows
Enemies and alliеs made
Be careful of thе ones who are unsure
The sting is more intense
To the bee than the cattle
So are you sticking out?
Speaking too loud could cast you to the wolves

So smile like a hostage
We hate to watch you
Staking your claim
As to better suit you
So we'll just smile and say
Thanks so much
You're too much
Thanks so much
And smile like a hostage
Thanks so much
You're too much
Thanks so much
And smile like a hostage

See you through the key

So smile like a hostage
We love to watch you
Fail your own game
Trying to suit you
So we'll just smile and say
Thanks so much
You're too much
Thanks so much
And smile like a hostage
Thanks so much
You're too much
Thanks so much
And smile like a hostage
Thanks so much
You're too much
Thanks so much
And smile like a hostageEmbed
