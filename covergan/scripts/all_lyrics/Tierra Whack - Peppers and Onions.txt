Peppers and Onions Lyrics
You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)
You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)

I'm only human, yeah
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)

I'm new to this game, I ain't been here long (Long)
So forgive me if I get this wrong (Yeah)
I get lost sometimes, Italy, I roam (Yeah)
I had to figure certain things out on my own (Woo)
Make a phone call home to the ones I love (Love)
Shit crazy out here, have you high on drugs? (Damn)
To be real, man, I thought about pullin' the plug (Uh)
So I can go fly high with the ones above (Ooh)
Yeah (Damn)
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn)
Even though we buy chains, we just wanna be free (Damn, damn, damn)
Peppers and the onions
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn, damn)
We just wanna be free (Damn)

You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)
You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)

I'm only human, yeah
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)

The pros and the cons of bein' the bomb
Baby, you can have the tick, it might not be your time (Yeah)
But often times I gotta remind myself
To combine my thoughts and never deny my health (Uh)
A whole lot richer and a whole lot quicker
But I had to slow it down, 'cause I ain't no grave digger (Ching, ching, ching, ching)
White folks yellin', "Yo, that's a brave nigga!"
Paparazzi takin' pictures like I'm in a cage, nigga (Woo)
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn, damn)
Even though we buy chains, we just wanna be free (Damn, damn, damn)
Peppers and the onions
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn, damn)
We just wanna be free (Damn)

You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)
You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)

I'm only human, yeah
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only human, yeah
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)4Embed
