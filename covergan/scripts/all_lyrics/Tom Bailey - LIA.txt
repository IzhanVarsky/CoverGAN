LIA Lyrics
Been a while since I felt something like this (like, like this)
And this time said I sure don't wanna miss it (miss it, miss it)
So do you mind if I talk to you for a minute
Oh Lia Lia really wanna get to know you Lia (ooh)
And I wonder maybe you already got a man (ooh)
Cuz I want you said I need you to understand
Ooh Lia Lia, oh Lia when I see ya
Oh Lia really wanna squeeze ya

Lia Lia oh Lia Lia
Lia Lia oh Lia oh Lia
Lia Lia oh Lia Lia
Lia Lia oh Lia oh Lia
[Verse 2}
With each day that passes on by
Oh I've been dreaming
About you, you and I
And all the things we could be doing
Summertime and the weather is fine
Fine for making love
Come on pretty sugar take my hand
Said I just wanna be your man
Lia Lia oh Lia Lia
Lia Lia oh Lia oh Lia
Lia Lia oh Lia Lia
Lia Lia oh Lia oh Lia

Said I wanna get lost in it (Lia, Lia)
Said I wanna get lost in it, ooh yеah yeah  (Lia, Lia)
Said I just got to have it  (Lia, Lia)
Little sugar givе it to me  (Lia, Lia)
Oh you're sweet so sweet, ooh yeah yeah yeah  (Lia, Lia)

I got to say I really love what you do
I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching
I got to say I really love what you do
I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching babyEmbed
