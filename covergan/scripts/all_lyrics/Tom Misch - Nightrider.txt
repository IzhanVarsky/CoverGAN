Nightrider Lyrics
Don't listen to what they say
You can’t take it slow
And when the Nightrider comes around
You gotta pick up the dough
I ride low with the setting sun
Mr. Dayes with the break of the drums
It's icy (cold)

Harley, Corvette
I be chasing you down, it's a wrap
So easily, so easily
High beam, on the dash
I be shaking you down, it’s a wrap
So easily, so easily

I got a feeling that won't come down
Can't do it alone
I'll take you to the fat of the land
This is where we go
Top-down with the cruise control
Lights out with the radio on
It's crazy
Harley, Corvette
I be chasing you down, it's a wrap
So easily, so easily
High beam, on the dash
I be shaking you down, it's a wrap
So easily, so easily

Yeah, yeah, should I bless the track or let it breathe?
Yeah, I need Salah, forgot to hit my knees
Yeah, Freddie Kane clocking overseas
Yeah, ice minus four degrees, put a ho at ease
Yeah, trap shit round you, sent your bitch on a round trip
Niggas put real diamonds in fake ass Rollies, that's clown shit
Every whip, I wish it was either German-made or Italian
Super dope, my geekers smoke media, Robert Townsend
Them pounds in, these niggas window shoppers, they browsin’
Put that on VL, I put VVs in my medallion
They can’t understand it, this gangster shit run a panic
I began and even when I was down and out, I was wild
I was wild, I just blessed the track, so let it breathe
Yeah, I need Salah, forgot to hit my knees
Freddie Kane clocking overseas
Rapper of the year, fuck the nominees
Harley, Corvette
I be chasing you down, it's a wrap
So easily, so easily
High beam, on the dash
I be shaking you down, it’s a wrap
So easily, so easily5Embed
