What Kinda Music Lyrics
What kinda music
Hey

I didn't make a sound
I was hidden amongst the crowd
Take another look around
I know that my mind will keep me down
In the corner of your eye
I'm a stranger you recognise
You go the way I go
Your words follow me home

(fieuw)
(Ooooooooo)

Can I make it clear
There's nothing to see here
The demons come and go
I know that with time they come around
Opened up a door
And I came back for more
It's too late to look back
Forever got this tag on me
(Ooooooooo)4Embed
