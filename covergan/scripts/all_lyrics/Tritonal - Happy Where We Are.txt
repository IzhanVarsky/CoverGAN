Happy Where We Are Lyrics
Everything I dreamed of is knocking at my door
I can't find a reason, but I still want more
Am I too selfish? Am I too wrapped up in my head?
'Cause nothing is working, oh, nothing

Will we ever be happy where we are?
And will we ever see without comparing scars?
Just breathe, just be
Maybe we will be happy where we are

Happy where we are
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Happy where we are

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Happy where we are
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Happy where we are
Happy where we are

Focused on tomorrow, but today's still here
Smoking all my problems, thinking they'd disappear
But they keep burning, all these questions in my head
'Cause nothing is working, oh, nothing
Will we ever be happy where we are?
And will we ever see without comparing scars?
Just breathe, just be
Maybe we will be happy where we are

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Happy where we are
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Happy where we are

Happy where we are
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Happy where we are
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)Embed
