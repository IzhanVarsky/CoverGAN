Knockout Lyrics
We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout

I say, let's stay, out tonight
'Til the, morning, you and I
Crossing lines, and wasting time
No heels, just feels
Going in, living, the dream
Follow the Ruby eyes, and Champagne smiles, yeah

We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout
We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout

K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout
I'm in, are you?
Think of the, things we could do
No matter what, we'll be fine
Yeah, we'll be fine, let's
Make some mistakes
Now that we're raising the stakes
You know we won't think twice
We're cool as ice, yeah

We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout

K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout

We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout

We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout
We are, burning the house down
Can't stop, no turning back now
Lights out, final round
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockoutEmbed
