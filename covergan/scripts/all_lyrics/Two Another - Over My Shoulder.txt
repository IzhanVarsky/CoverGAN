Over My Shoulder Lyrics

All I need is a little more from you
I never meant to put you to this test, oh yeah
'Cause I know that I never did trust you
’Cause you know I can't always be my best
And that's why your love
Is away
On my shoulder
And that’s why your love
Every day
Leave you colder

There's why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)
There's why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)

Just what I want girl really ain't worth debating
I just need your trust to get me through, yeah
She coming at me like the stonemen
She digging hole so I could fall in
But is it worth it for you?
'Cause I could give you
Anything you want
But you ain't done enough for me, my love
I won't come back from
Looking anymore
Already had enough of you
And that's why I got no weight on my shoulder

There’s why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)
There’s why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)

It's unlike you, my love
It’s unlike you, my love
It's unlike you, my love
It's unlike you
It's unlike you, my love
It’s unlike you, my love
It's unlike you, my love
It's unlike you
There's why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)
There's why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)
There's why you look
Over my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)
There's why you look
Over my shoulderEmbed
