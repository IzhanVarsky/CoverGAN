For How Long LyricsYou don't like to share, I do
Oh, I love and care for a lot of you
Can't you see the way I do?
No? That's okay, that's cool
You don't like to share, I do
Oh, I love and care for more than one of you
Can't you see the way I do?
No? That's okay, that's cool
So long, yeah
I've been waitin' for it so long, so long
Hold on, yeah
You keep tellin' me to hold on, hold on
How long? I keep waitin' for you
Tell me, how long?
So gone, yeah
I love you, baby, but I'm so gone, so gone
I keep waiting on a moment
Somethin' to show me where the hope is
You keep on sayin' that you love me
But for how long? Yeah
You're sayin' that you love me? Yeah
For how long?
You don't like to share, I do
Oh, I love and care for more than one of you
Can't you see the way I do?
No? That's okay, that's cool
You don't like to share, I do
Oh, I love and care for a lot of you
Can't you see the way I do?
No? That's okay, that's cool
You don't like to share, I do
Oh, I love and care for more than one of you
Can't you see the way I do?
No? That's okay, that's coolEmbed
