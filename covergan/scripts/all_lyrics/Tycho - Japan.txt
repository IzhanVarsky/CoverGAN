Japan Lyrics
Came home from Japan
On your own when you landed
I don't know how it happened
You got me spinning round for you
To tell you the truth
So you can't say I didn’t warn you
I'm bad, but I'm good
I'll be so good to you

Hey, yeah
Oh, I’m on a roll
Hey, yeah
Steady as she goes
I won’t make
This a touch and go
But don’t wait
For me to come home

I’m gonna break her down
She don’t mind at all
She don’t mind
I’m gonna break her down
She don’t mind at all
She don’t mind at all
At all
She don't mind

Came home from Japan
On your own when you landed
Don't know how it happened
You got me spinning round for you
To tell you the truth
So you can't say I didn’t warn you
I'm bad, but I'm good
I'll be so good to you

Hey, yeah

I’m gonna break her down
She don’t mind at all
She don’t mind
I’m gonna break her down
She don’t mind at all
She don't mind

Came home from Japan
She don't mind
Came home from Japan
She don't mind
Came home from Japan
She don't mind
Came home from Japan
She don't mind
Came home from JapanEmbed
