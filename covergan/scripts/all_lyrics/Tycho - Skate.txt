Skate LyricsDangerous, I like to keep it a little bit dangerous
Won't be too good for love
I'm serious, I like to keep it a little less serious
Am I too good for love?
Oh, baby, breathe now
Roll down the window
No conversation, no conversation
Oh, feel the breeze now
Roll down the window
Don't complicate it, complicate it
No, I won't save you but I'll show you how
Get yourself off the ground
Not gonna let you down
Yeah, we could skate all day and all night long
Oh, we're flyin' now, not gonna let you down
Hey, yeah
Come down now
No, I won't save you but I'll show you how
Get yourself off the ground
Not gonna let you down
Yeah, we could skate all day and all night long
Oh, we're flyin' now, not gonna let you down
Oh, baby, breathe now
Roll down the window
No conversation, no conversation
Oh, feel the breeze now
Roll down the window
Don't complicate it, complicate it
Hey, yeah
Come down now, come down now
Yeah, hey, yeah
Come down now, come down now, yeahEmbed
