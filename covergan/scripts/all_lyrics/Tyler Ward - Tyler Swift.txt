Tyler swift Lyrics
She wore a little black dress in the middle of spring
I'm sitting outside on the front porch swing
That pretty long blonde hair girl gone and caught my eye
So I stroll on by like the summer breeze
Noticed she was poppin' to a T-Pain beat
Would you mind if I stopped in and told you 'hi'?

Am I mistaken?
My hands are shakin'
Could this really be?
You belong with me

'Cause I first saw you in a video
Talking 'bout why you had to let him go
And I was noddin' my head right there sayin' this ain't fair
Like the firework flash on the fourth of July
Or the sunset fallin' from the summer sky
The prettiest scene is you just marryin' me
I even promise you this
I'll change my name to Swift
'Cause that's when I think happiness
The way you wear that little black dress
Baby, just say yes
Last night's dream that's how it went
For thirteen minutes I was heaven sent
Then I fell right back down to my reality
So I roll the dice, no more time I'm wastin'
I won a contest at the radio station
Just for that one shot at a meet and greet

Am I mistaken?
My hands are shakin'
I finally get to meet
The girl who wrote "Fifteen"

I saw you in a video
Talking 'bout why you had to let him go
And I was noddin' my head right there sayin' this ain't fair
Like the firework flash on the fourth of July
Or the sunset fallin' from the summer sky
The prettiest scene is you just marryin' me
I'll even promise you this
I'll change my name to Swift

I say 'hi, my name is Tyler, nice to meet you, how's your day been goin'?
And 'hi' my name is Taylor, nice to meet you, how's your night been goin'?
And I, I can see her in my future, writing songs together
And yes I could see ya in my future
Just Taylor and Tyler Swift
I meet you at the Denver show
Your long blonde hair girl heaven flow
I'll be right there backstage if you need anything
Like the firework flash on the fourth of July
Or the sunset fallin' from the summer sky
The prettiest scene is you just marryin' me
I'll even promise you this
I'll change my name to Swift
'Cause that's when I think happiness
The way you wear that little black dress
Call me Tyler SwiftEmbed
