Lifeline Lyrics
Broken bottles on the bedroom floor
Sleepless nights, no love, no more
You pull me in so you can shut me out
Again and again and again

Is it too late for love?
Too late for apologies?
Too late to find a way home?

Throw me a lifeline
This is too much
Why are we drifting apart?
Throw me a lifeline
I'm missing your touch
I can't live without your love
Woah Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum

I'm paralysed
Lying in bed
Trying to escape the thoughts in my head
Broken bottles on the bedroom floor
Waiting for you to come and knock on my door
Is it too late for love?
Too late for apologies?
Too late to fund a way home?

Throw me a lifeline
This is too much
Why are we drifting apart?
Throw me a lifeline
I'm missing your touch
I can't live without your love
Woah Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum

Deeper, deeper, it's pulling us down
Deeper, deeper, comfort the ground
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper
(Deeper, deeper)

Throw me a lifeline
This is too much
Why are we drifting apart?
Throw me a lifeline
I'm missing your touch
I can't live without your love
Woah Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
Dum dum dum da da da da da da dumEmbed
