Always Lyrics
How many ways can you say it so?
How many days do you need to sober up? Yeah
All these questions never ending
Why do I keep going if I'm absent
When I don't run from anybody else? Why?
The house has always been here

Oh, forget about everything you heard
Just know I will be loving you always, always
Always and forever grateful

How many times do I need to say that?
I have to think twice right before I speak, yeah
Something about you seems so magical
I cannot lie when I look into your eyes, your eyes
Oh, so overwhelming

Oh, forget about everything you heard
Just know I will be loving you always, always
Always and forever grateful
Oh, I need you now more than you know
So plant the seed and let it grow, always
Always and forever grateful (Always and forever grateful)
Oh, forget about everything you heard
Just know I will be loving you always, always
Always and forever grateful
Oh, I need you now more than you know
So plant the seed and let it grow, always
Always and forever gratefulEmbed
