Selfish Lyrics
Take a little something for your heartache, for the better
We don't need to leave now, we can stay here forever
Yeah, you got soaked, intentions are good
Don't care if they never notice
I feel we've been here before, yeah

Go ahead and call me selfish for holding onto my love
I didn't believe in magic before you
But go ahead and call me selfish, but I didn't give you up
I didn't believe in magic before you

I can feel the thunder and the lightning from within me
Am I too emotional, irresponsible to be carefree? Ooh
You don't have to justify your sins
We sink and we swim, we lose and we win
Maybe it's a no return, but you're always on my mind

Go ahead and call me selfish for holding onto my love
I didn't believe in magic before you
But go ahead and call me selfish, but I didn't give you up
I didn't believe in magic before you
Hey, I've been too proud to let it go
I've been too stupid to let you know that
It doesn't matter who is wrong or right
'Cause I'm not afraid anymore
Hey, I've been too proud to let it go (What'd you say?)
I've been too stupid to let you know that
It doesn't matter who is wrong or right
'Cause I'm not afraid anymore

Go ahead and call me selfish for holding onto my love
I didn't believe in magic before you
But go ahead and call me selfish, but I didn't give you up
I didn't believe in magic before you1Embed
