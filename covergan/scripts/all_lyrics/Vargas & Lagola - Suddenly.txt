Suddenly Lyrics
Suddenly I feel changes now
Suddenly I feel weightless now
Suddenly I feel chainless
Oh dear mama, little did I know
Suddenly I feel changes now
Suddenly I feel painless now
Suddenly I feel chainless
Oh dear mama, little did I know

Up and down and round and round a roller coaster
Never leave your side until the war is over
Babe, you say the world is heavy on your shoulders, shoulders
Listen to our records singing picture perfect
Wonder why we never stop, we're always searching
Smiling when you're telling me it's always worth it, worth it

Suddenly I feel changes now
Suddenly I feel weightless now
Suddenly I feel chainless
Oh dear mama, little did I know
Suddenly
Suddenly
Suddenly
I do my best to try to use a little patience
But I never found a reason to be waiting
'Cause I know the sound of a heart when it's breaking, breaking
Easy to be wise after a good night's sleeping
Using all your powers never count as cheating
Babe, I know the signs of freedom when I see 'em, see 'em

Suddenly I feel changes now
Suddenly I feel weightless now
Suddenly I feel chainless
Oh dear mama, little did I know
Suddenly I feel changes now
Suddenly I feel painless now
Suddenly I feel chainless
Oh dear mama, little did I knowEmbed
