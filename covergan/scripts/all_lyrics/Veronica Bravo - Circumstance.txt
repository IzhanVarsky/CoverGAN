Circumstance LyricsWe got too much going on
To let it go
It’s everybody else
Not our fault
Don’t say you’re sorry no
It’s getting old yeah
We just talked it out
And now we’re gold
Everyone’s too loud
Can’t hear us though
I’ll paint over that frown
So we can move on
Don’t worry it’s all good now
We’ve ironed all the kinks out
We should go to bed now
And try and get some sleep
Don’t worry I won’t leave now
We’ll focus on the good somehow
Cause they all got their heads down
And we’ve been losing sleep
Don’t worry, don’t worry
I love ya, I love ya
It’s all good, it’s all good
It’s all good, it’s all good
Don’t worry, don’t worry
I love ya, I love ya
It’s all good, it’s all good
Baby I understand
It’s just the circumstance
Things been out of place
But I won’t leave
We been holding out for days
Even weeks
All we need is space
Permanently
Are you here to stay?
Am I misconceived?
Some just always get their way
I believe
If it’s not today
When will it be?
Don’t worry, don’t worry
I love ya, I love ya
It’s all good, it’s all good
It’s all good, it’s all good
Don’t worry, don’t worry
I love ya, I love ya
It’s all good, it’s all good
Baby I understand
It’s just the circumstance
Don’t worry it’s all good now
We’ve ironed all the kinks out
We should go to bed now
And try and get some sleep
Don’t worry I won’t leave now
We’ll focus on the good somehow
Cause they all got their heads down
And we’ve been losing sleep
Don’t worry
Don’t worry
You’re flying like kings now
Up in the clouds
Up in the clouds
Don’t worry, don’t worry
I love ya, I love ya
It’s all good, it’s all good
Baby I understand
It’s just the circumstanceEmbed
