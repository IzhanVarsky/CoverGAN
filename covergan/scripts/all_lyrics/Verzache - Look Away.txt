Look Away Lyrics
Just cool it, only got a matter of time
And I never used ya, didn't see a warning sign
Got used to dealing with your pretty little lies
And I felt it better than I ever did in my life (On that night)

Why'd you look away?
Wha-What was it something that I said?
I'm feeling super great
And I cannot feel my face
I'm just screaming like-

Ah, oh, ah, oh
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
I'm just screamin' like
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah

'Kay, well everything's a part of me
The pop culture, the jewelry
I order on my phone
And they send it to my home
The internet is fucking me
I wanna charge, they watch for free
I kick it all alone
Hope they don't make me a clone
Don't need no apology
'Member what it did for me
Nothing on its own
Same words, different tone
Want me to sweep you off your feet
Will do it, well, probably
It's tough out in the cold
And this love is just a loan
Why'd you look away?
Wha-What was it something that I said?
I'm feeling super great
And I cannot feel my face
I'm just screaming like-

Ah, oh, ah, oh
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh

Weekdays I just let em run away
Shouldn’t spend no time guessing what you’re gonna say
Its not my problem
These thoughts still moshing
Heart pumping, still don’t wanna pass away
But I can’t stand living like this up in any way
What you want then?
These thoughts still moshing

Why'd you look away?
Wha-What was it something that I said?
I'm feeling super great
And I cannot feel my face
I'm just screaming like-
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-ohEmbed
