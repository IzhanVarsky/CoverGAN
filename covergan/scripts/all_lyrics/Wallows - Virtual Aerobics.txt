Virtual Aerobics Lyrics
Hey there, safe travels
Read it, I unravel
Simple words that might
Kill me, let's spend the night

Doing some virtual aerobics
Hey, watch my grapevine and my sidekick
I’m not too good, but I try my best
Work hard no matter what happens next
Wanna dress in what makes you like me
I'll probably overwear these Nikes
I'll clean ’em off when they get a scuff
Tell me when you think they've had enough

There's no color in San Francisco
You laughed and said, "Just look around you"
Being here for the first time with you
It lets me see it totally new

Yeah, you called me out like that (Like that)
Yeah, you made me blush like that (Like that)
Only been here one night, leavin' doesn't feel right
We could live a life like that (Like that)
I love how you move like that
I love how you kiss like
When we aren't together, fuck all of the weather
I'll get to your side like that
Side like that, side like, side like
I'll get to your side like that
Let’s spend the night
Doing some virtual aerobics
Hey, watch my grapevine and my sidekick
I’m not too good, but I try my best
Work hard no matter what happens next
Wanna dress in what makes you like me
I'll probably overwear these Nikes
I’ll clean 'em off when they get a scuff
Tell me when you think they've had enough8Embed
