Pulse Queen Lyrics
Hey fool
Hey newcomer
Talk big
No tone
Touch machine
So inviting
With a taste
For soil

Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
You cannot fool me
Take a picture in your red g
Don't forget another selfie
Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
You cannot school me
See the stains in your gold teeth
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake scene

Hey pretender
Talk cheap
Walk bold
Silver spoon
With no money
Such a waste
Of foil
Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
You cannot fool me
Take a picture in your red g
Don't forget another selfie
Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
You cannot school me
See the stains in your gold teeth
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake scene
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake

Ah, there goes the pulse queen
You cannot fool me
Take a picture in your red g
Don't forget another selfie
Ah, there goes the pulse queen
You cannot school me
See the stains in your gold teeth
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake scene

Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
You cannot fool me
Take a picture in your red g
Don't forget another selfie
Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
You cannot school me
See the stains in your gold teeth
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake scene
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake
Yeah I'll pass up on your fakeEmbed
