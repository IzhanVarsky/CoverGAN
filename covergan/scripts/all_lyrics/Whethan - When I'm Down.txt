When Iâ€™m Down Lyrics
My head blows up when I'm alone
Inside out, I might explode
I shut my eyes and my mouth and my legs just gave out
Why in the world would you hit me when I'm down?

When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down

I get lost in and out when you walk in and out
Turn my hair in a knot, I get stomped in the ground
When I'm down
When I'm down
I get lost in and out when you walk in and out
Turn my hair in a knot, I get stomped in the ground
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down

My head blows up when I'm alone
Inside out, I might explode
I shut my eyes and my mouth and my legs just gave out
Why in the world would you hit me when I'm down?
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down

I'm down if you're down, there's no way around it
I'm down if you're down, there's no way around it

When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down
When I'm down13Embed
