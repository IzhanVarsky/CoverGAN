Plum Lyrics
Feel the bruising through the skin
It won't go back to being green again
Try to hold on to the sweet
Where the softness used to be

I feel nothing
I feel dumb
You're a peach and
I'm a plum

Feeling less then revealing more
The stone that's buried: what the fruit is for
You were in bloom in your own time
I was there, but wasn't mine

I feel nothing
I feel dumb
You're a peach and
I'm a plum
I'm a plum

No one is old, and nothing is young
You're a peach and I'm a plum
No one is old, and nothing is, nothing is young
You're a peach, you're a peach and I'm a plum
I'm a plum
I'm a plum
I'm a plumEmbed
