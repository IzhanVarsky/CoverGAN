True Colors LyricsYou with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize. it's hard to take courage
In a world, full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Your true colors, true colors, true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Show me a smile and don't be unhappy
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And You've taken all you can back
You call me up, 'cause you know i'll be there
But I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Your true colors, true colors, true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraidEmbed
