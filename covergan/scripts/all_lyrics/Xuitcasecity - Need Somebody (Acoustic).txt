Need Somebody (Acoustic) Lyrics
I know you getting tired of Versace and the loafers
You got every pair but need somebody that could hold ya
'Cause you had a hole in your heart that the bags can't fill
Pain in your eyes that the cash can't heal
Wake up every day waiting for it to be over

You had a taste of love
But he fucked up and now you're numb
You said you're over and done
Over and done with love

I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love
We all need somebody
We all need somebody
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love

Need your lovin', I put no one up above ya
If you don't like you a secret I keep you so undercover tho
No one knows about you don't mean that I don't trust you
Girl you got my heart and can't nobody take it from you
Take you everywhere you want to go and not your money
Livin' pages of the past movin' forward different story, yah-yah
Different chapter, yeah
Twitching on my faction, yeah
I'm infatuated, yeah
Got me so distracted, yeah-yeah
Girl, I'm locked in, don't know why you asking now
Treat you like my music
I love you with a passion, yeah
Yeah the taste of love but he fucked up and now you're numb
You said you're over and done
Over and done with love

I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love
We all need somebody
We all need somebody
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love

I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love
We all need somebody
We all need somebody1Embed
