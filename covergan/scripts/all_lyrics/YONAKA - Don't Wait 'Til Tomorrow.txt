Don’t Wait ’Til Tomorrow Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

If you're lonely you can call me, don't you know?
I'll be right here for you
It doesn't matter where you are up in this world
I will always pick up the phone

I will always pick up my phone
I will always pick up my phone

Though it seems that I don't really care
I'm just caught up in it
I'm sick and tired of you thinking it's unfair
When you put yourself there

It could never be too late
To call me up and come my way
I would love to see your face
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
We could take it back to when
We were young and were best friends
I will help you through this mess
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh

It's all love, Heaven's above
I'll be at your side when you've had enough
I know that I'm not perfect
But if God gave me this much
When you're drowning, I'm gonna dive in
I'm gonna help you climb that mountain
Just know I'll be there, remember that I care
Whenever you need me just reach out and call my name

It could never be too late
To call me up and come my way
I would love to see your face
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
We could take it back to when
We were young and were best friends
I will help you through this mess
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
I'm screaming down your walls
Can you hear me at all?
Can you hear me at all?
'Cause I'm crying out your pain
I'm trying hard to get through
I'll be there when you fall
If you need me at all
I'll be there to fix you

It could never be too late
To call me up and come my way
I would love to see your face
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
We could take it back to when
We were young and were best friends
I will help you through this mess
Don't wait 'til tomorrow

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't wait 'til tomorrow)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't wait 'til tomorrow)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh2Embed
