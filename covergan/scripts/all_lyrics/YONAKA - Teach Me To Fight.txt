Teach Me to Fight Lyrics
Small town baby, got his knickers in a twist
Doesn't like the way that this curse leaves my lips
Fuck what you think, I'm not trying to impress you
I'll probably just upset you, you're tryna' be your best you

Suited and booted, but got no money
Tryna' act a grownup, now that's pretty funny
I thought I'd have it worked out and I'd be making plenty
I'm feeling pretty empty, this attitudes expensive

Take a trip and you might find...

Let's make this public, let's take it outside
Put down your small-talk and teach me to fight
Let's make this personal, stop wasting my time
Get out my way, I'm sick of being polite

Caught in the mirror, can't recognise your face
Trying too hard, yeah it's gonna make you age
Walk into the room, everybody looks the same
I'm so tired of this place, yeah
Why you scared of change, yeah?
Too many photos and not enough friends
Waiting on the next fad on the next trend
Posers in the hall and they clogging up the stairways
Working on their bitch face
Come on baby, let's play!

Let's make this public, let's take it outside
Put down your small-talk and teach me to fight
Let's make this personal, stop wasting my time
Get out my way, I'm sick of being polite

And it's all I seem to see
And it's all you seem to know
Bet you're itching to find out
Where the party's gonna go
So you turn up at my door
But you don't know anyone
And the party's over now
Can't you see you're on your own?

Let's make this public, let's take it outside
Put down your small-talk and teach me to fight
Let's make this personal, stop wasting my time
Get out my way, I'm sick of being polite
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, ooh oooh3Embed
