DINNER PARTY Lyrics
Set the table, place flowers 'round the room
Light the candles and don't pour the drinks too soon

Don't waste your life waiting 'round
Know yourself
Don't waste your life waiting 'round
Throw yourself a dinner party
Throw yourself a dinner party
Throw yourself

Out the window you can hear the people laugh
You can offer them a cocktail, but what's the sense in turning back?

You spend your life waiting 'round
Treat yourself
Before your soul hits the ground
Throw yourself a dinner party
Throw yourself a dinner party
Throw yourselfEmbed
