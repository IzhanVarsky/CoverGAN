Dreams Lyrics
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you made in the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Now here I go again I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dream you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you made in the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Thunder only happens when it rains
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll knowEmbed
