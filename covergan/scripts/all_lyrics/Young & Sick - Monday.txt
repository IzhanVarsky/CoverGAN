MONDAY Lyrics
It's Monday and I'm in love
There's always something to live and die for
My head may hurt, but my heart doesn't ache for once
And the only thing blue are the dreamy skies of New York

Ooh, ooh

It took me thirty-two years to believe in me
And it'll be another ten to love myself, oo!
And I know I should look after my mental health
But for now, it's Monday and I'm in love, oo!

Aah, aah

It's been a while since I felt this naked
I wish I liked myself better naked
But there's comfort in knowing I'm not alone
It's Monday and I'm in love
In love with you

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
In love with you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
In love with you
Aah, aah
