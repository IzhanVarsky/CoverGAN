No Static LyricsThe mornings are getting harder
And my nights, they aren't so pure no more
The stories are getting old
And like wine, they stain the floor
And now I'm getting sick and tired
Of getting sick and tired again
Looking in the mirror
Asking when are you gonna save me (my love)
But I've been getting on myself quite well
I can do it without (my love)
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, all love
I hear you loud and clear, it's alright
I won't panic, won't break down (my love)
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, all love (my love)
I caught my reflection in the water
I'm showing wear and tear, oh
I'm getting fed up with being fed up, oh no
I'll take control, I swear (my love)
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, all love
I hear you loud and clear, it's alright
I won't panic, won't break down (my love)
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, all love (my love, oh)
(My love)

I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, I, I
I hear you loud and clear, it's alright
No panic, I, I
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, all love
I hear you loud and clear, it's alright
I won't panic, won't break down (my love)
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
No static, all love (my love, oh)
(The early hours ain't pretty. What about doing music full of regalia ready the world , at least my home? Generally happy, and you're partly to blame. I hear you loud and clear. All love, no static.)1Embed
