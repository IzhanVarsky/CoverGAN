Sleepyhead Lyrics
Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat

And you said it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid, burning thin, the burning rim
Like the stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I drag you back

Sleepyhead, ooo
Sleepyhead, ooo

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thought wearing thin
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
My beard grew to the floor and out the door
And out your eyes, begonia skies
Sleepyhead, ooo
Sleepyhead, ooo
(Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat)Embed
