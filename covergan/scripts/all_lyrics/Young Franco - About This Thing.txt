About this Thing Lyrics
Hold up

Here I come, here I come
Can't have one if you ain't lost none
Big big poppa bear call me the dun
This one free nizzle in the sound system
Here I (huh)

Big big poppa bear call me the dun
Can't have none if you ain't lost one
This one free nizzle in the sound system

Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
Hey send a friend to a friend
Step out, you know I be the creme de la creme
Busy with the flow and I be busy with the pen
Little rascal like dizzy in the ends
Call 999 for the ting I got
Cause it's bombai when the baseline drops
Flip modes switch flows where'd you get that from
Rude boy really better make that chit chat stop (Whoop)
Now its time for somethin' you love
Tell it from the start I'ma tell it from the jump
I ain't gonna lie and I ain't gotta front
I just come here to (smash) someone
I just come here to show some love
Still hot steppin' in my air max ones
FWW yeah they call me the dun
When I come through I make the bass go (whoop)

Yeah, so what you know about this ting
What you know about this ting
(Whoop, whoop, whoop)
What you know about this ting
Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
Yeah, what you know about this ting
What you know about this ting
(Whoop, whoop, whoop)
What you know about this ting
Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
(And it goes like)
Who's hot who's not
Came with the boom box on the rooftop
New drops got the crew hot on the new block
Baseline bangs from here to Newcross
Pull up in the club came in the uber
Sky walking kinda like Lucas
King for the good vibe like Luda
Call me king kinda like Luther

Yeah, what you know about this ting
What you know about this ting
(Whoop, whoop, whoop)
What you know about this ting
Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
Yeah, what you know about this ting, what you know about this ting
(Whoop, whoop, whoop)
What you know about this ting
Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
Yeah, what you know about this ting

Come out the way when I shot this, shot thisEmbed
