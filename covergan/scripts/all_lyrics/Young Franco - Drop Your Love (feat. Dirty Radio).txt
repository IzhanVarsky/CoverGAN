Drop Your Love Lyrics
I go hop on the bus
So we can meet up at your spot
You go and roll one up
So we can lay back and smoke up
I trip when I kiss your lips
Cause you taste just like mimosas
You feel all that I give
Cause that's just how you're 'sposed to

I'll chill with ya if you want to
Live like dynasty
I'll chill with ya if you want to
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on me
That's just how you're 'sposed to

I almost missed the bus
That brings me right up to your spot
Make sure that you roll one up
So we can lay back and smoke up
I trip when I take a step
Cause I'm always thinking of ya
You feel all that I give
Cause that's just how you're 'sposed to
I'll chill with ya if you want to
Live like dynasty
I'll chill with ya if you want to
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on me
That's just how you're 'sposed to

I'll chill with ya if you want to
Live like dynasty
I'll chill with ya if you want to
Drop your love on me

That's just how you
That's just how you
Drop your love on me
All your love on me
That's just how you
That's just how you
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on me
That's just how you
That's just how you
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on me
Drop your love on meEmbed
