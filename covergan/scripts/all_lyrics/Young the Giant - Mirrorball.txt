Mirrorball LyricsLook into the glass
Mirror ball
Everybody has reason to fall
The world is round
And heavy in my mouth
Living in the past
Time is lost
I know I have made mistakes
Hiding in the dark
The world is small
Through my mirrorball
It's over now
Go on, tear me apart
Am I a ghost?
Give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep
You're all I see
Am I a ghost?
Spinning out of control
Looking for some action...
Opposite attraction
The world is small
The world is small
Through my mirrorball
It's over now
Go on, tear me apart
Am I a ghost?
Give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep
You're all I see
Am I a ghost?
Spinning out of control
The wait is over now
I finally figured out
(we are the ghost) 
And I told ya, I told ya I know...
Cuz I told ya!
Told ya I know5Embed
