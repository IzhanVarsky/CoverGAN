Elmer LyricsI never wanna be apart
I wanna stick to you like Elmer's glue
I should've known from the start
You wanna be with me for the time being
(Oooh) Why you hide me from your girl friends?
Like I hide you from my girlfriend you
Only wanna break my heart
Only wanna break my heart
Guess our secret's hard to keep when
We both got a lotta getting even to do
So when you say you're sick of me and leavin'
Part of me's deceasin' to you
You owe it to us both
Just an explanation
Why you gotta go in the middle of vacation?
I told you that I love you
I told you that I'd leave her
But only if you leave his punk ass in the dirt
I never wanna be apart
I wanna stick to you like Elmer's glue
I should've known from the start
You wanna be with me for the time being
(Oooh) Why you hide me from your girl friends?
Like I hide you from my girlfriend you
Only wanna break my heart
Only wanna break my heart
I'm staring to believe them
Every single lie I told her about us
You and I are barely even work friends
That I am someone worthy of trush
You made me lose my way
Everything I stand for is out the door
What was it even for?
Girl I gave you my love
But it wasn't enough
I never wanna be apart
I wanna stick to you like Elmer's glue
I should've known from the start
You wanna be with me for the time being
(Oooh) Why you hide me from your girl friends?
Like I hide you from my girlfriend you
Only wanna break my heart
Only wanna break my heart
I just wanna make you mine
But that's just a waste of time
I'll save my breath
You're worse than methEmbed
