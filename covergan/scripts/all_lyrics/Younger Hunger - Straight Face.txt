Straight Face Lyrics
You know that I can't keep a straight face
I wanna kiss your neck
And touch your face
I wanna hold you on a cold day
You know I'm falling fast
Falling your way

I don't wanna waste your time
I've got no money and I'm dead inside
Plus I got problems that are hard to hide (to hide)
I'm addicted to your face
You're the kind that I always crave
Just one taste and I'm far away (away)

I don't smile enough (enough)
But the second you show up

You know that I can't keep a straight face
I wanna kiss your neck
And touch your face
I wanna hold you on a cold day
You know I'm falling fast
Falling your way
You're sweet like a lemonade
Medicine for a foggy day
Just one taste is enough

I don't smile enough (enough)
But the second you show up

You know that I can't keep a straight face
I wanna kiss your neck
And touch your face
I wanna hold you on a cold day
You know I'm falling fast
Falling your way

(I don't smile enough) (enough)
(But the second you show up)

I can't keep a straight face
You know that I can't keep a straight face

So mosey your way down to Norma's Double R Diner, where the juice is cold, but the coffee's always hotEmbed
