Summer Bummer Lyrics
Wake up in summer
Everything's a bummer
Tomorrow the world will be
Safe from me
I think I need a minute
How could I be 22?
So many things left to do
I gotta breathe a second
Before I break my limit
Over and over again

Wake up in summer
Everything's a bummer
But these days
I can't run away

I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
Without you babe
I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
Without you babe
(Summer)
(Bummer)
(Summer)
(Bummer)
I burn my calendar
And all my furniture
Just things I do not deserve
I could work harder
Thoughts getting darker
No one
Is really a friend

Wake up in summer
Everything's a bummer
Tomorrow the world will be
Safe from me
Wake up in summer
Everything's a bummer
But these days
I can't run away

I can't run away
I can't run away
Without you babe
I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
Without you babe
(Summer)
(Bummer)
(Summer)
(Bummer)
I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
Without you babe

Wake up in summer
Everything's a bummer
Tomorrow the world will be
Safe from me1Embed
