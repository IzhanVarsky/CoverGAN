Juicy Sushi Lyrics
I'm crying at the party
'Cause you like wasabi
I–I'm no beginner
My tongue roll like ginger
Inside out, you're salmon trout
Baby, you're down
Make me go drown
Oops, got no bikini
Just, just like sashimi

Juicy sushi
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi
You and me in my jacuzzi
Juicy sushi
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside out

Juicy sushi
You and me in my (Jacuzzi)
J-J-J-Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside out
Juicy sushi
You and me in my (Jacuzzi)
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside out
Ah, alright (I don't–)
You don't like it fried
You're on a diet
That's fine
But what about the sides?
Ah, alright (Yeah)
You don't like it fried
You're on a diet
That's fine (That's fine)
Just let me be your sides (Alright)

Juicy sushi
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi
You and me in my jacuzzi
Juicy sushi
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside out

Juicy sushi
You and me in my (Jacuzzi)
J-J-J-Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside out
Juicy sushi
You and me in my (Jacuzzi)
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside outEmbed
