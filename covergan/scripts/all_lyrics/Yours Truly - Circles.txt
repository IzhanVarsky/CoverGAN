Circles Lyrics
So let me know if you're hearing this
Don't cut me off, don't call me "Miss"
Don't blame it on your design
No need to patronize
The way you act ain't right
And I'm over it
Yeah, frankly, I'm just sick of it
What makes me different to you?
I got nothing to lose
And everything to prove

Oh, I fail to see these so called changes
You need to stop and just let it go

What's inside your head?
Can you explain it?
We just go in circles
We just go in circles
Don't say you're mislead
You knew it, you messed up
We just go in circles
We just go in circles
Let me assure you, I'm serious
Don't think you should get used to this
Not gonna listen when you pretend to compromise
When the way you act ain't right
And I'm over it
Just seems a little ridiculous
We're all apart of the fight
Haven't you heard the news?
It's time to change your views

Oh, give me faith in how you're changing
(And don't say that "we gotta get over it")
You need to stop and just let it go

What's inside your head?
Can you explain it?
We just go in circles
We just go in circles
Don't say you're mislead
You knew it, you messed up
We just go in circles
We just go in circles
(And don't say that "we gotta get over it")
(And don't say that "we gotta get over it")

What's inside your head?
Can you explain it?
We just go in circles
We just go in circles
Don't say you're mislead
You knew it, you messed up
We just go in circles
We just go in circles2Embed
