Undersize Lyrics
Oh, down the drain, wash it away
Just like storm water
Let it strip you of the things
You wish you didn't notice (Didn't notice)
It may take some time
Our waterways don't always flow the same
The same

And I swear you'll see it bloom
(Never the same, never the same)

Hold your virtues now
Searching for blue butterflies
(Never the same, never the same)
Try to stay afloat
While you're swimming in pools
Treading undersize

And don't you drown, I'm counting on
Seeing you get wiser
And when the tide's too hard to bear
This is a reminder
You can't stare at the sun
And hope it never fades, it still gets dark
Gets dark
But there's still light from the moon
(Never the same, never the same)

Hold your virtues now
Searching for blue butterflies
(Never the same, never the same)
Try to stay afloat
While you're swimming in pools
Treading undersize

Find an ivory tower
Cover yourself in the wind, it's closing in
Spiral in your atmosphere
Can you take things slowly?
Nothing grows overnight

I swear you'll see it bloom
(Never the same, never the same)

Hold your virtues now (Hold your virtues now)
Searching for blue butterflies (Searching for blue butterflies)
(Never the same, never the same)
Try to stay afloat (Try to stay afloat)
While you're swimming in pools (While you're swimming in pools)
Treading undersize
We're just swimming in pools
Treading undersizeEmbed
