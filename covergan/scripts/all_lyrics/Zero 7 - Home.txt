Home LyricsLost in cheap delirium
Searching the neon lights
I move carefully
Sink in the city aquarium
Sing in the key of night
As they're watching me
Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
Cause lately I've been losing on my own
Wrapped in silent elegance
Beautifully broken down
As illusions burst
Too late to learn from experience
Too late to wonder how
To finish first
Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
Cause lately I've been losing on my own
Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
Won't you take me home?
Won't you take me home?
'Cause lately Iâ€™ve been losing on my own
Won't you take me home?Embed
