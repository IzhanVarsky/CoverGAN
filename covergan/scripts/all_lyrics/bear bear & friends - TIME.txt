TIME Lyrics
Time flies by when you're in the dark
Do you really wanna fall apart?
I feel like I am falling in reverse
You said you’d never try to leave my side
But all you ever told was lies
I can face the demons on my own

I’m made of stardust, I'm blowing away
Who knew you would seal my fate?
You said you’d never try to leave my side
But all you ever told was lies
I can face the demons on my own

I can face the demons on my own

Time flies by when you're in the dark
Do you really wanna fall apart?
I feel like I am falling in reverse
You said you’d never try to leave my side
But all you ever told was lies
I can face the demons on my own
I’m made of stardust, I'm blowing away
Who knew you would seal my fate?
You said you’d never try to leave my side
But all you ever told was lies
I can face the demons on my own

I can face the demons on my own

Time flies by when you're in the dark
Do you really wanna fall apart?
I feel like I am falling in reverse
You said you’d never try to leave my side
But all you ever told my slice
I can face the demons on my ownEmbed
