​leave me alone! Lyrics
No me quiero ir

What do you mean?
You can't possibly be meaning the words that come out of your mouth
You wanna go home, but I just wanna have fun
You say that you're tired and want me to calm down
I was shy at first, but they welcomed me
There's way too many reasons to stay here
Just 'cause you want to, I don't think that it's fair
I'm putting my foot down, I'm staying here

I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna

Are you leaving now?
Are you serious?
The truth is that I don't wanna stay without you
And if we go, we'll miss it all
I'm sleepy too, I promise this will be worth it
(It's getting late) But I'm not nearly done
(I miss my bed) Let's hang out, come on
(Are you really sure you don't wanna come with us?)
Yeah
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna

¡Oye, Wachito!
Dime
Nos tenemo' que ir
¿Qué?
Nos tenemo' que ir
¿Se van ahora, al tiro?
Si pue', Brayan está bien cansado
¿En serio? Pero la estaba pasando bien po, quédense un poco más po hueón
Ah, tranqui, quédate
Yapo


I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna1Embed
