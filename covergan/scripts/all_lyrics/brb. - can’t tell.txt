​can’t tell Lyrics
I can't deal with no emotion
Been wasting all that to devotion oh
I'm cashing short of all the notions
Is this a dream or just delusion, shit

Knife cold, she knows, I can tell she's kryptonite
Lost in her dose but I'm getting out tonight
There is no us that is a no go
And now I guess I'm going solo

I can't even tell she's gone
The writings on the walls
Don't say it anymore, yeah
I can't even tell she's gone
No echoes in the hall
Can't hear them anymore no

You can keep all your commotion
I been around yeah did I mention?
Someone you know from recollection
It's not a dream not a delusion
Knife cold, she knows, I can tell she's kryptonite
Lost in her dose but I'm getting out tonight
There is no us that is a no go
And now I guess I'm going solo

I can't even tell she's gone
The writings on the walls
Don't say it anymore, yeah
I can't even tell she's gone
No echoes in the hall
Can't hear them anymore noEmbed
