​cool with it Lyrics
You see, I'm higher then I've been before
Caught in loops I can't ignore
Running wild on fantasy
I'm not used to this tranquility Yeah
She's always writing, could be poetry
Within her rhymes if I could find a me
Picture perfect if we're meant to be
It could be love or just a fantasy

I could get you on the phone
Maybe even get you all alone
Watching from the window on the street
Maybe even get you in the sheets now
You can tell me on your own
What you want and maybe what you don't
You got everything I want
Cause I'm everything you need

If you’re gonna be cool with it, cool it
Girl you should know
I could be cool with it, cool with it
Takin it slow
We could be cool with it, cool with it
Thought you should know
It's just me and you tonight
No one else that's on my mind
You got me hanging in the safe zone
No I can’t even comprehend if I can defend my position
You can take your time but hey no reservation and I
We'll start a coalition based on what you're feeling and I
You call it love, call it lust infatuation
I know it's tough to make a revelation of the things that are going on
The things that don't belong
We'll take it step at a time cause I’ll always be stuck on your mind

I could get you on the phone
Maybe even get you all alone
Watching from the window on the street
Maybe even get you in the sheets now
You can tell me on your own
What you want and maybe what you don't
You got everything I want
Cause I'm everything you need

If you’re gonna be cool with it, cool it
Girl you should know
I could be cool with it, cool with it
Takin it slow
We could be cool with it, cool with it
Thought you should know
It's just me and you tonight
No one else that’s on my mind1Embed
