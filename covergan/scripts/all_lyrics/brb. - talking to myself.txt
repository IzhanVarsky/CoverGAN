​talking to myself Lyrics
You know I can't stop thinking
About how you keep on missing
What’s not me what I could be
Late nights have got me feeling
Like I should keep on listening
To the streets turn out the heat

I can't make magic
Taken for granted
Can't say its over
Lover and I
Keep talking to myself lately
Keep talking to myself lately

I know we got together and forever but
Gotta find a way to make it work without
All the ones know I can’t do
A compromise yeah I know it's true
So let us all fall into consensus
With right and wrong we'll find our fixes oh
I mean we can pretend
But I'm benevolent
Just so you know
I can't make magic
Taken for granted
Can't say its over
Lover and I
Keep talking to myself lately
Keep talking to myself lately

Remember how we used to
Feel like nothings better
Walked to your doorstep thinking
I can't live without her
Eyes closed for a minute
Feels right now in it
Hands around your waist
Real talk, no gimmicks
Yeah she's a witch

I can’t make magic
Taken for granted
Can’t say its over
Lover and I
Keep talking to myself lately
Keep talking to myself latelyEmbed
