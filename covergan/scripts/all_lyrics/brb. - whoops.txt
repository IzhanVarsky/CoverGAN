â€‹whoops Lyrics
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Don't need the one thing
Don't wanna keep on trying
You got me thinking it's not right yeah yeah
You got me feeling
Like maybe you're that one thing
And now I can't tell left from right yeah yeah

Must've been that drink that you gave to me
What was in it?
I can't tell you lies even if I tried
Got me sipping on that dirty cup
Girl you got me drunk and I can't help it
Wanna keep drinking you up
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Wanna keep drinking you up
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Wanna keep drinking you up
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup

It could've been for nothing
But honestly it could've been the right thing
You got me right where you want me
Dirty or not yeah you got it
Running through my mind damn you so refined
It might be worth the wait
Oh no, and now I'm just your prey

Must've been that drink that you gave to me
What was in it?
I can't tell you lies even if I tried
Got me sipping on that dirty cup
Girl you got me drunk and I can't help it
Wanna keep drinking you up
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Wanna keep drinking you up
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Wanna keep drinking you up
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup
