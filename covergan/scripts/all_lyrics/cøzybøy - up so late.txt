​up so late Lyrics
Might as well start how you ended
Lost in a feel when I sent it
Wavy feeling so wavy
Falling into each other
I was pulled right under
Nothing like saying I lover her
Heartbeat felt like thunder
We were falling under

Oh I been up so late baby so late
Thinking about your lips on my face
I been so caught up how can I stay
Would you even notice if I fade
If I fade
Would you even notice if I fade
All these red roses that I slay
And place on your bedside when I stray

Mmh mmmh
Ey ey
Hey dear tell me are you cold
With a heart made out of stone
Gave back just so you know
I don't wanna know a thing about you
You was reckless when we met and I fucked with it
Retrace my steps and you done did it
I ain't wanna believe a damn thing about you
They say don't go she tore my heart into two
Fuck
Got me so turnt up
I ain't been sober since last month
Shorty you done wasted my time
Wish I never made you mine oh
Oh I been up so late baby so late
Thinking about your lips on my face
I been so caught up how can I stay
Would you even notice if I fade
If I fade
Would you even notice if I fade
All these red roses that I slay
And place on your bedside when I stray
If I fade
If I fade
Would you even notice if I fade
All these red roses that I slay
And place on your bedside when I strayEmbed
