​gf haircut Lyrics
I like your hair but it's getting kinda long and I think
When I have the time I could maybe write song about it
(Write a song about it)

Some things go wrong but it's better not think about it
I'll tag along like a scary movie that you're watching
I won't look 'til you tell me that it's over
I won't look 'cause it's scarier than I remember

I don't wanna be stuck with your girlfriend haircut
But I don't want it cut by anybody else
When I hand the scissors it's a promise that we'll stick together
I hand the scissors, I'll really try to keep it together

Hey, I talk too much
(I don't wanna be stuck with your overgrown haircut)
Hey, don't cut too much
(I don't wanna be stuck with your overgrown haircut)

Don't you think the weather's been kinda off lately?
I really hope that I'm not driving you crazy
Is it my hair? Is it a problem? Do you wanna cut it?
It's just like Pavement when they wrote that song about this (Stop it)
Hey, I talk too much
(I don't wanna be stuck with your overgrown haircut)
Hey, don't cut too much
(I don't wanna be stuck with your overgrown haircut)

These strands are falling one by one onto the ground
Smile with my eyes, this song is done, our locks are wound
I hope it's not too late to talk about it now
I hope it's not too late to talk about us now

I hope it's not too late to talk about us now
I hope it's not too late to talk about us now
I hope it's not too late to talk about us now
I hope it's not too late to talk about us nowEmbed
