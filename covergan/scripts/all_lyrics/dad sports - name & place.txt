​name & place Lyrics
Christie is running through your door
Wonder how she's been here before
Will I still be around for you
In a year or two?

Why do I never feel?
It's almost like this isn't real
But I still see you so
And you still see me too

He said it's all inside your head
Calm down and fall back 'til you're dead
But I'll still leave without a sound
In a day or two

Why do I never feel?
It's almost like this isn't real
But I still see you so
And you still see me tooEmbed
