​out 4 a breather LyricsOut for a breather, sit in the dark
Someday I'll have you wonder
What we would look like face to the stars
Maybe I'll have you over
Carrie said that we don't have the time
To ever make it matter
Held on the stakes I'm slipping away
She'll never like me that way
Do you know my name
I think you're kinda cool
Do you wanna hang
Maybe after school
Caught by her gaze, not turning away
Wondering what she's thinking
Doesn't it seem like so much to think
Maybe she likes me that way
Brushing the wind, so caught in the ties
Blushing away, so caught in your eyes
Never complacent, always redundant
Follow the feeling, say what you're meaning
Do you know my name
I think you're kinda cool
Do you wanna hang
Maybe after school
Aren't you tired of my voice
Said you didn't have a choice
Aren't you tired of my voice
Said you didn't have a choice
Do you know my name
I think you're kinda cool
Do you wanna hang
Maybe after schoolEmbed
