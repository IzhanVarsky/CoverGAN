Winning Lyrics
I don't care what people say
Really, I don't care
Make no difference anyway
Haters, I don't hear

I'm too busy fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
I'm fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
I'm too busy fucking winning

Haters, I don't hear
I'm too busy fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
I'm fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
I don't care what people say
Really, I don't care
Make no difference anyway
Haters, I don't hear

I'm too busy fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
I'm fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
Losing, no no no
I'm too busy fucking winning

I don't care what people say
Really, I don't care
Make no difference anyway
Haters, I don't hear

I'm too busy fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no no
I'm fucking winning, fucking winning
Fucking winning, fucking winning, fucking winning
Losing, no no noEmbed
