Infinite Lyrics
I can finally breathe under water
I have learnt to sleep on the clouds
Take me for a ride
Infinite beside

On the other side I'll be singing
Well beyond the night, and past the sun
As if I'm lost, I'll be fine
'Cause I've been lost all my life

Take me for a ride
Infinite beside
Take me for a ride
Infinite beside

And I've become lost in time
And everything ends inside
It's far beyond open skies
'Cause I've been lost
All my life (take me for a ride)
All my life (infinite beside)
All my life (take me for a ride)
All my life (infinite beside)Embed
