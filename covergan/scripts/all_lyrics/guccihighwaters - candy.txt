​candy Lyrics
I might have to block you, know it's for the better
Trust me, don't wanna forget you, no
Lips taste sweet like candy
And I don't really know nothing better

This ain't new, I been through this
Couldn't give a fuck if I lose this
Regret it all when I do it
So why do I do it? Emotionally clueless
Feeling so foolish
Why I'm fucking with you, bitch?
Feeling so stupid
But I've been reflecting, I'm losing the best thing

For the better, for the better
Left your lipstick stain on my sweater
For the better, for the better
This love won't last never ever

I might have to block you, know it's for the better
Trust me, don't wanna forget you, no
Lips taste sweet like candy
And I don't really know nothing better
She said I'm a savage, so I let her have it
Playboy bunny ice her out with karats
Take a trip to Paris, make her feel careless
You can be my girl but we ain't getting married
When I'm gone, will you miss me? Gone, will you miss me?
Out of bounds I've been drifting, bounds I've been drifting
Off these pills, off these drugs, so much stress, when's enough
Hold my breath, need some peace, need some love
All this time that I've wasted how?
In the air, it makes me sick, and I can taste it now
I been glued to my bed, too much shit inside my head
I can't sleep, I just weep, drown in whiskey that ain't cheap
Close my eyes, I see your face
Every time we speak, you speak in tongues, I run in place
Love is just a sweet mistake we make, could give you all
But how much will it take? Oh, how much will it take?

For the better, for the better
Left your lipstick stain on my sweater
For the better, for the better
This love won't last never ever

I might have to block you, know it's for the better
Trust me, don't wanna forget you, no
Lips taste sweet like candy
And I don't really know nothing better
She said I'm a savage, so I let her have it
Playboy bunny ice her out with karats
Take a trip to Paris, make her feel careless
You can be my girl but we ain't getting married5Embed
