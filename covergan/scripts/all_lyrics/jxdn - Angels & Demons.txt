ANGELS & DEMONS Lyrics
Two face, two face, yeah
Black, white, left, right, yeah
Up, down, all night, yeah
Can't escape it ever
Don't forget my name
I don't feel the same
On a trip, no train

And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden

So fuck me like a rock star, dancing on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rock star, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out

Everybody said that I'm falling, uh
Took another line, I'm calling, uh
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit, uh
I don't really think I'm the problem
I don't really think it's a problem
Me plus me is a problem
One gunshot could solve 'em
Tell my friends I'm sorry, though
T-t-t-tell my sins to go
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden

So fuck me like a rock star, dancing on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rock star, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out

(Rock star, rock star)
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm falling from Eden

So fuck me like a rock star, dancing on a cop car
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rock star, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out
So fuck me like a rock star, dancing on a cop car
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rock star, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out
(Rock star)
(Fuck me like a rock star)70Embed
