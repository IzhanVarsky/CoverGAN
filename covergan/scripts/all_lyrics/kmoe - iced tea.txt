​iced tea Lyrics
Took the bus home 'cause it was pouring
Texted you all night until the morning
Woke up by the sound of myself snoring (Snoring, snoring)
But you're ignoring me
I've got nowhere else to be now
I'm bored and I'm weak
But then you texted me
(Hey)

Oh, so you said hadn't thought of that
(Hadn't thought of that, I hadn't thought of that, yeah)
Hey, pulling at my heart like that
(At my heart like that, had my heart like that, yeah)
Hey, forgot that's when it started, back when it started
(Back when it started, back then)
Hey, one sec, I gotta call you back, gotta call you back
Gotta call you back

I said I could be your sugar honey iced tea
When I see your face I'm really thinking that you might be
Mine, for the rest of the time
I got nothing to hide, I got nothing to hide
I said I could be your sugar honey iced tea
When I see your face I'm really thinking that you might be
Mine, for the rest of the time
I got nothing to hide, I got nothing to hide
Oh, so you said hadn't thought of that
(Hadn't thought of that, I hadn't thought of that, yeah)
Hey, pulling at my heart like that
(At my heart like that, had my heart like that, yeah)
Hey, forgot that's when it started
(Back when it started, back when it started, back then)
Hey, one sec, I gotta call you back
(Gotta call you back, gotta call you back)

(I said I could be your sugar honey iced tea)
(When I see your face I'm really thinking that you might)
Be mine, for the rest of the time
I got nothing to hide, I got nothing to hide
I said I could be your sugar honey iced tea
When I see your face I'm really thinking that you might be
Mine, for the rest of the time
I got nothing to hide, I got nothing to hide2Embed
