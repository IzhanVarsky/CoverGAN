1-800-DATEME LyricsGuy after guy
Crush after crush
Never really figured it out with someone
I can't deny
I'm quick to gush
But it never works out so I'm done
It's Valentine's Day
And I'm lonely and single
But it's better this way
I don't like to mingle
I'll be my own valentine, it's fine
I'll be my own valentine
Wow lucky to be
My own valentine
Oh my God wow I'm so lonely
Sorry, sorry, back to the song
Mmmmmm, mmmm, mm mm
Oh guy after guy
Crush after crush
I never really figured it out with someone
Even though I cry, I'm not in a rush
I prefer Netflix over everyone (I'm so Tumblr! Hashtag relatable.)
It's Valentine's Day
And I'm lonely and single
But it's better this way
I don't like to mingle
Please date me!3Embed
