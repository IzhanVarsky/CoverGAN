​feelings are fatal Lyrics
I'm happy for you, I'm smiling for you
I'd do anything for you, for you
It’s always for you and never for me
And I need it to stop so let me tell you, please

I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
But I can’t tell you that I'm breaking slowly
Closed doors, locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden, there is no ease
I need it to stop and I want to be able to open up
But my feelings are fatal, my feelings are fatal

How many times must I keep it inside
I need to let go and I swear that I've tried
But opening up means trusting others
And that’s just too much, I don’t want to bother
So I'll keep it inside and bury it deep
I know it’s not healthy but you won’t hear a peep

Though I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
I could never tell you that I'm breaking slowly
Closed doors, locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden, there is no ease
I need it to stop and I want to be able to open up
But my feelings are fatal, my feelings are fatal
My feelings are fatal35Embed
