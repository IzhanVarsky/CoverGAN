​​hong kong Lyrics
Red brick and bamboo towers
Line the skyline with much power
Yellow cars and smoggy skies
With neon lights that attract your eyes

Hong Kong is moving around you
You can't help but stand there in awe
Hong Kong is moving without you
But you can't help and drop your jaw

A home away from home
Yet, oh, so far away
Been years since I've been back
And my memories will slowly fade away
My memories will slowly fade away

Late nights were alright
And dim sum was always fun
Big family with too much food
Oh, just eat more and don't be rude

Your family is living without you
All the way across the sea
Your family is moving without you
No matter how much you plea
A home away from home
Yet, oh, so far away
Been years since I've been back
And my memories will slowly fade away
My memories will slowly fade away

I don't know when I'll be back
It feels like I'm losing track of time
My memories, they feel so vivid
Yet so much time has passed
You're missing a piece of yourself
You left it behind you there
You're missing a piece of yourself
Don't it feel so unfair

That your family is living without you
All the way across the sea
Your family is moving without you
No matter how much you plea
Maybe one day you'll see them again
Maybe one day you'll seeEmbed
