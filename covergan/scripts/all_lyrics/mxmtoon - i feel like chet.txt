​i feel like chet Lyrics
It’s really bad, I fall too hard
One simple chat, I’ve got no guard
I feel like Chet, it’s way too easy falling in love
Oh, isn’t that cheesy, oh, isn’t that cheesy
I sit around all day just listening to love songs
Thinking about how someday my someone will come along

I’m a hopeless romantic afraid of commitment
But I can’t help that I like to think
Though my glasses are tinted rose pink

I feel like Chet, but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
(My glasses are tinted rose pink)
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat

I live on dreams above the clouds
Creating crushes out of crowds
Molding stories out of clay
And knowing that it’s all for play
It’s all for play
I’d like to believe that something could happen with me
But I don’t talk and I don’t chat
I just lay awake hoping I’ll find the key
I’m a hopeless romantic afraid of commitment
But I can’t help that I like to think
Though my glasses are tinted rose pink

I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
(My glasses are tinted rose pink)
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
(Ooo-ooo-oooo-ooo-oooh)
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
(Ooo-ooo-oooo-ooo-oooh)
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat6Embed
