​ok on your own Lyrics
I had to go, I'm sorry
I hope you'll understand
That even though it's over
You know it's not the end
I couldn't be your half
Just forming out a whole
I can't complete you, baby
Find solace in your soul

And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
But your story can not start until you've grown
You can find how to be okay on your own
I just can't be the one that makes you feel at home

I need some time to myself
So I can comprehend
I'm not so scared to admit
I could use a friend
I need some time to myself
To gain some confidence
Another confidant
'Til I can fall again
Thought that I'd feel empty
I just want a hand to hold
But now that it's all over
My life isn't so cold
It wasn't meant to bе
Maybe we knew that from thе start
I can't complete you, baby
But I'll hold you in my heart

And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
But your story can not start until you've grown
You can find how to be okay on your own
I just can't be the one that makes you feel at home

I need some time to myself
So I can comprehend
I'm not so scared to admit
I could use a friend (A friend, yeah)
I need some time to myself
To gain some confidence (Ooh)
Another confidant
'Til I can fall again
Ooh
I could use a friend
Maybe we knew that from the start
It wasn't meant to be
I could use a friend, a friend, yeah3Embed
