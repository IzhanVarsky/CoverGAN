â€‹porcelain Lyrics
My skin is a story
With marks and lines, it makes me feel weary
My face is like a galaxy
With spotty freckle stars and no sense of gravity
But even with the good
The bad feels so much stronger
My inner demons, they always win
And in my mind they saunter
So many things that I've come to hate
They line my body and caress my face
I feel so frail and empty too
Like a china tea cup with dried out glue

I am made of porcelain
I'm cracking now and then, it wears me down
And I am made of porcelain
I look okay but I am breaking down
Over and over again
Oh, over and over again

Stretches and patches corrupt my flesh
Slowly eating away any confidence that's left
And I really wish I wouldn't let
My appearance dictate how much I fret
Because they say what's inside is what really matters
But I really can't seem to ignore
The parts of me that I abhor
It makes me feel like I am weak and battered

I am made of porcelain
Cracking now and then, it wears me down
And I am made of porcelain
I look okay but I am breaking down
Over and over again
Oh, over and over again

Oooooo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
Oooooo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
Oo-oo-oooo3Embed
