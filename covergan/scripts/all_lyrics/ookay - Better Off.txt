Better Off Lyrics
I was feeling good all by myself
Until you came around asking for help
I really don't mind being alone
I've gotten used to dinner with my phone

And you can try all you want to convince me
That I need something more
Something more, something more
And you can try all you want to convince me
That I need something more
Something more something more
But I'm better off alone

I'm better off alone (Yeah)

It's been a couple days since I've left home
And when I do I keep my headphones on
You know I really don't mind being alone
I've gotten used to dinner with my phone

And you can try all you want to convince me
That I need something more
Something more, something more
And you can try all you want to convince me
That I need something more
Something more, something more
But I'm better off alone
I'm better off alone (Yeah)

And you can try all you want to convince me
That I need something more
Something more, something more
And you can try all you want to convince me
That I need something more
Something more, something more
But I'm better off alone

I'm better off alone (Yeah)
I'm better off alone
I'm better off alone (Yeah)Embed
