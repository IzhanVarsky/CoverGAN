Cool Lyrics
I see you standing in the corner looking for somebody
To come to you
You only move a muscle when you sip on your Bacardi
Like I wouldn’t understand, but I do

And I know you want to
Get up and get loose
But it’s all up to you
(And everybody knows that)

You’ll never be too cool to dance
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you want to you can take my hand
(And everybody knows that)
You’ll never be too cool to dance
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you want to you can take my hand

The music’s getting louder and I feel like this is a party
I can make you groove
If you’re feeling kinda nervous well then baby you’re invited
Just step into my shoes
Now watch you move
Now I don’t know what you came here to do
And if you don’t know really you should get a clue
Just come a bit closer now
And lemme show you how
(show you how)
And I know you want to
Get up and get loose
But it’s all up to you
(And everybody knows that)

You’ll never be too cool to dance
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you want to you can take my hand
(And everybody knows that)
You’ll never be too cool to dance
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you want to you can take my hand

And I know you want to
Get up and get loose
But it’s all up to you
(And everybody knows that)

You’ll never be too cool to dance
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you want to you can take my hand
(And everybody knows that)
You’ll never be too cool to dance
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you want to you can take my hand1Embed
