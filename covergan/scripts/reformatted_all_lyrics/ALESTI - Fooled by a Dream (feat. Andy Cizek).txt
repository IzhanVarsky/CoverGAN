No one is special, we're all just the same
Is a liar, a liar (A liar, a liar, a liar)
Is a liar, a liar (Liar)
Oh, oh, oh, with all to lose and nothing to gain
We watch as it ceases, looking back at what we became
It's not enough, I won't give up until I climb atop this wall
The future we're making is in the fabric we weave
Why even bother, all this effort just to get by?
We're looking to others and living a lie
It's not enough, you can beat me around
But you'll never see me crawl, you'll never see me crawl
There's no way that you will get any higher, higher
There's a line in the sand that you cannot cross
We stop in concern while chances keep on passing us by
So quench your desire, desire
We're placing the pieces, we're playing the game
Oh, oh, oh, there's no limit to what you can achieve
Don't let no one tell you what you should believe
And whoever tells you to go follow your dream
We live and we learn, we dream, then we die
Don't be fooled by a dream
There's no way of taking before we receive
So it's better to extinguish your fire, your fire
It's not enough, this can't be all, it's not enough, don't let me fall
There's a chance you'll get burned
