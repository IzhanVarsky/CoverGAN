Wonder if that came from the heart
At this point, I'm thinking, I'll probably die lonely
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind games
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind
When you said, you loved me
The girl I really love, don't even like me
Such a beautiful mind had me out of the physical
Spend time to figure you out with no manual
But girl, the feelings you had me feeling unusual
I'm probably not lucky, this love shit not for me
Wasn't mutual
Stop playing mind games
I'm spilling out my feelings, try not to sound corny
But then I found out the love we had wasn't mutual
