You're all I need
I wanna see that pretty face
It's been a long day
Let's go!
None of my business
I think I'm obsessed
Baby girl let me ease your mind for a second
And We should stress less
You are my ocean vibe
I'm tryna impress you
Know, I'm trynna be the best
Hit you up with a morning like
I think we need to chill
Hey sleepy head
I wanna love you the best
I'm her bullet proof vest
Hit you up in the afternoon
Sit on my lap
We built our own nest
(where the wind blowing)
You're all I want
Help you relax
That's a real life fable
No, I don't mean any harm
Put your head on my chest
Free birds and we flying
Hope you're not following where the wind blowing
Hoping you can see my effort
Wrap you in my arms
She said, she feels safe with me
Yet I'm trynna invest
Till your mind get stable
Guess you're the Empress
Take you up on a journey
How's your day going
