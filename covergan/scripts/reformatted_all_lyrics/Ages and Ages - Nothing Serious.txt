Serious
Telling me all is either dying or dead
But I don't wanna give you too much
Where they go, you know I really can't say
Even though it doesn’t change a thing
Take the line out of my head
Everyone walking in a million different, million different ways
It's not serious
And I don't wanna tell you too much
But I don't wanna tell you too much
I only wanted to be honest enough so you know
It’s nothing serious
Hiding the fact I feel a little out of place
I only really wanna tell you enough so you know
I know there's love in every word that you said
Repeating itself since I woke up out of bed
It's nothing serious
Or let you think it’s shaking me up
I can’t keep on digging myself into a hole
Or let you know it's shaking me up
And I'm thinking myself into circles
But when I look out, my feet are on the same ledge
Oh no no no no
Hide anymore, I’ll disappear with no trace
Telling me how I had some miles ahead
I'm hiding the thoughts you probably read on my face
And the only thing normal is it's always so strange
