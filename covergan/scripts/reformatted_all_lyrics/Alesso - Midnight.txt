And fall right into you (Oh)
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Any problem, we'll figure it out
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
Like a rock, I was set in my ways
Always thought I was too far from grace, yeah
Always thought I was losin' the race
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
I was numb before, but now I feel
Really don't know how we made it here
Never thought I was worth what you give
And fall right into you
Never felt quite alive, now I'm livin'
Yeah, when I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around
Any love lost, we'll bring back around
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Any broken heart, we'll make it heal
Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Yeah, you kill my doubts, they disappear
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
