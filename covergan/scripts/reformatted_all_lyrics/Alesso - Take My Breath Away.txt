I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how
Take my breath away
We ignite, we're slipping like sand
Don't you know you excite me like that
Burning lights, hang over head
Got me running right back
Higher heights to shallow breaths
Want it, want it, want it, want it, and I want it now
Holding tight, never, never end
Body high, swimming in my bed
Pull me down to ecstasy
When you touch me like that
