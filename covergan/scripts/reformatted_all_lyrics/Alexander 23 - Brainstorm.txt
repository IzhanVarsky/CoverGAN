When you close your eyes? Is it far?
But I see no smoke down from the ground
Oh-oh
Where do you hide
Where you are
But I see they're safe and sound
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You say the building's burning down
But salt water is rolling down your neck
You swear to God the stairs are meltin'
Wish you could stay with me instead
So what would it take for you to stay?
But when it comes to this, my money is
What would it take for you to stay?
Too far to hear me scream?
When nobody knows where you are?
Where are you?
How bad's the weather in your head?
Expensive green and white papier-mâché
You swear to God it's rain
No, no, no, no, no
(Where are you?)
'Cause there's not a dollar I wouldn't pay
Oh, where do you go
Oh, where do you hide
