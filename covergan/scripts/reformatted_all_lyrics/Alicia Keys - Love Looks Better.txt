All I, all I ever wanted
And now it's you I'm missing
Every day
My love looks better on you
'Cause all I wanna do is you
Coming, coming from the bottom
Stop for a minute?
Oh, can we touch for a second?
Find, find what I'm made of
Find, find what you're made of
Feel like my love is wasting
Every day, yeah
You're all I ever wanted
Don't matter what I give it to
Alright
So can we talk for a minute?
Run, run through the street now
Get so damn tired of chasing
Better learn how to dance
Was a dollar and a chance
Hold up
All I wanna do is you
Be us for a second?
Promise you, baby
Was a city and some keys
Just stop for a minute
