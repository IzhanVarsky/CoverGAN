So here we go again
At the bar drinking way too much
I promise if you’re with me say the word and we’ll find a way
We’ll talk about how your parents separated and
Somewhere in Neverland
We sing along to "Forever Young"
And weekends with our friends
So here we go again wishing we could start again
The weekends with old friends spilling into to routine
Wishing we could start again
Don’t you see what you do to me?
How you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
I wanna be your lost boy
Wendy we can get away
Wendy run away with me
Of great times with far better people
I know I sound crazy
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your "everything better" plan
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth
Say goodbye to the halls and the classes
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
We’ll start a life of the plain and the simple
Like your life is a map with no compass to guide
Your last chance, a better reality
And trying to feel forever young
Tell me how you feel over and done with
Say hello to a job and the taxes
