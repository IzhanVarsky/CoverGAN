A blank aura, chameleon
And strangers, they stop and stare
I've had my share, I've made amends
And everybody stops and stares
Open your eyes, don't lose that spark
In no need of decadence
They say I am not from here
Images that can't compare
To the real thing
We need light, it's far too dark
Not too suave but understand
Staring at the second wind
A puff parade of elephants
In the air
At the odd familiar
