Don't cry for me, don't cry for me
Bad luck, bad love
So don't cry for me
I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe (Breathe)
Oh, so don't cry for me
One life, too much to see
Somebody told me I was done
And I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe
Thought I was ready, but my timing's bad, yeah
I'll bite my tongue, I'd say nowhere was wrong
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
No, no, please don't cry, please don't cry for me
But please, don't cry for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Don't cry)
Don't cry for me
And I said, "Hey, I had better days"
Too young, too fast
If you thought I was down, if you thought I was losing sleep
I'm still picking up the pieces, and now I was number one
I climbed the ladder, it was never enough, no
If you thought I was down, if you thought I was losing sleep (Yeah)
Jason Derulo
Well, I'm still goin' hard eight days a week
Every lonely night are teardrops in the sea
Yeah, I miss that train by a mile away
Somebody told me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
