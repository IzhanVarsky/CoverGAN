Yeah, every time I feel amazing y'all niggas hating
Gang up on the dudes tryna fool with us, they just wanna cool with the cool niggas
Look, now I'm in the loop, running round like a hula hoop, hoop
Less money in checkings, more in the savings
Yeah, look, getting all the loot, know I got it like a interview-view
Only into entertainment on the occasion
Making light for the bros who can make the truth

Kicking all these dope flows tryna loop
Ballin' like I'm blue, wit it
