You give me life I don’t break you cause I’m responsible
I hold you in the sky when I brush my teeth
Connected is a crucial, I need a question answered—ask Google
I always see how much of attention that I can give you
Not knowing I need that pat on the back to feel like the shit
Before I put her face first in the pillow, I’m a put you face first in the pillow, then you on silent
Appreciation for applications you carry got me lost in that other world
The orders they follow so insubordinate
I guess I’m still in love—who can break my phony habits?
Or when you freeze for no reason, I be yelling in yo face
No heart eyes—guess I ain’t handsome
I yell at my G like, "Whats wrong with the service in here?"
With zero likes—guess I ain’t important
Would hate to watch you fall like a ornament made of porcelain
So when I wake, it’s obvious you a hundred percent
I wanna shake off my addiction, I’m slowly at it
Don’t be keeping you safe or remotely as treasure
But I hold yo' home down—we can start over—okay, I’m sorry
And I’m tryna find the coordinates
In that other realm it’s like a tournament
You was cheating on me with the plug every night and it's cool
And every time I turn on the T.V., it’s only static
I hooked you up right before I fell asleep, right?
And I’m constantly looking for ya’ll approval
Shorty argue with the waiters like, "Whats wrong with the service?"
You almost died last night talking to my friends
My head turn every time hearing you alert
Only time you piss me off is when I did drop you on my nose
Vibrating every second so you hail boastful
When I lay down, I look up to you like I suppose
Which is mainly the reason they don’t look the same in real life
I ain’t even on my block yet, at green lights you was making me post like a drop step
Don’t be hard on yourself, I just need to multitask better
You ain’t the reason that I crashed my car
I can’t have shining on the ceiling o’clock in the morning, that conversation ain’t that important for real
And lately I been feeling assumptions are kinda fickle
And every time we run into a fuckin’ red light
No filter to human body when it’s vaguely in site
Putting others in danger, only care about yourself don’t you?
Waking up, it’s a ritual just to look through you
I ain't find love but I found a charger though, uh
I got a plate of food—let me take a picture of it first
I’d rather pick you up then to pick up a holy passage
In a realm where they give corny niggas a orphanage, damn
This shit is horrible, this day in age it’s so inaudible
Nobody follow back, I ain't gon' be shit in this world
One domino effect all the dominoes
Maybe I got to show ‘em something from my past just to get love, they quick to rejuvenate what you had
Still in the car, three minutes away from home
Shorty said, "Where the waiters in here? I’m tryna purchase."
Waking up, it's a ritual just to look through you
I made sure my hands gave you a hug every night
I’m always checkin your background
On you making me antisocial
Yeah
But with the same finger scroll right pass like I don’t exist
My head down all the time so I’m so focal
Don’t need a mirror when I got you there looking at me, uh
On the way I live my life, ya’ll push me one forth of the way
You so smart with a twinkle in your eye, who could turn your brightness down?
You was never on my rug every night
I keep you covered 'cause your only glass sweater
I keep you face up right on the dinner table case you got something to tell me
When I got you in my hand, I don’t be making no disturbance
You gotta paint the shit that you facing, thats self portrait
Shorty knock you out my hand she jealous
But it makes sense, so I can be on you all day
Why you making me tell my friends that I’m home but I’m not yet
Guess I'm still in love—who could break my phony habits?
Quarter push like the carts at price right
Forget the cookies with my Chinese, that's less fortunate
Yeah, who could break my phony habits?
I’m waiting for you to give me the signal
