Now everyone but us
And I know you know it too
Now I'm waking up in your bed
So blind to consequence
We are caught in a past life
They say insanity is trying the same thing
I moved fifteen blocks away
Thought that last time was the last time
We are running around again
As you said you needed space
We keep trying this expecting to pull through
I say we are better off as strangers
So why are we like this
We must be insane cause
But expecting something new
Can see that this is done
Guess the last time wasn't the last time after all
Then I drink too much and call
But I know that that's not true
What a sad sight
It seems like it never ends
