Welcome to Wonderland, we've got it all
Laughing till the morning comes
Dancing through a dream
Welcome to Wonderland
Maddest of hatters, the Cheshire Cat
Potions and pastries that make you grow tall
Magical cabins and lovely white rabbits with clocks
Is the song that's inside of your heart
And the only thing sure from the start
Welcome to Wonderland, I’ll be your guide
If this was a dream then at least I’ve got
There's a tea party along down the road
Now that I must leave with a heavy heart
Oh, Wonderland, I love
Forests and cottages, castles and cards that can talk
Make an appearance and maybe they’ll sing us a song
Let's go exploring or we could just go for a walk
Everyone that leaves has a heavy heart
Where should we go?
Don’t let it leave
Holding your hand under sapphire skies
Memories for when morning comes
Not sure if anything is real or a dream
Underneath the stars
Welcome to Wonderland, look where you’re at
Nothing around here is quite as it seems
