We are the echo of violent truth
And we are the disease, we are the disease
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
Misery loves the company
The viral outbreak to kill the untrue
Critical shutdown of false virtue
You are the cancer
That brings you to your knees
(You're a disgrace of the disease)
We are the whisper of the lit fuse
(The misery, the company)
We are the voices in the static
You have a sickness
We are the roll call of the pursuit
Hello?
We are the fire in the attic
Apathy is feeding the machine
Yeah, we are the disease
We are the disease
We are the voices and we reject you
(And we reject you, and we reject you)
And we are the disease
(Your apathy feeds the machine)
