I was at the wrong time in the wrong place, yeah
Turned out that I got my riches
'Cause all you'll get is silence
That everything you do is like one big circle
'Cause you had something to say
Don't talk to me
You've gotta have faith in thе way that you are
'Cause I prefer your
And she wasn't the one
I had to hear it second hand
That you tried to call me last night
Get back, don't touch
I've had enough of you messing around, boy
And I hеard (I heard)
And I heard
'Cause I found someone new
You went out and had a good time, boy
Shut up, sit down
It all comes back to you
So I went out and had a good time too
'Cause I prefer your silence
And you found a little fun
Why can't you tell me to my face?
Nothing but silence
Now I know that it's true
'Cause I don't wanna hear
Tell me how you feel
Don't talk to me (Don't talk to me)
(It all comes back to you)
For livin' in nothing but silence
There's no defense
Well, I heard
Yeah, and now you're talking again
Silence
Don't you think that you were running too much of it?
She looked fine but the timing was wrong
