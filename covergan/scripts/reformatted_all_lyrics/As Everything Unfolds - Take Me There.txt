Take my hand, let's set you free
All I know has been taken away from me
Sweet comfort in your close kept lie
We have called out for you in the night
But the devil, he lives within us
We have faltered on all your advice
Are we tainted or is it human nature?
It's not sinful living life as strangers
We shall not stand in cages
Only free when we let our minds unleash
Take me there, to the place where you reside
Blindly led to faith with no choice who we meet at the gates
Just because you believe He loves you
Allow yourself to see the light, question and defy
Question and defy
No sign, no feeling, no hand of healing
We won't live words from pages
Your holy words are nothing but you still try
The sight of heaven is all around us
Where apostates become divine
Apostates become divine
Gives you right to criticize what path we come through
