Silver boots make when they're fleeing town
And I can't get around to being
Born to fail
Pretty soon, I will be feeding
Much surprised by memories speeding
That we wrongly have been naming "love"
From the blood we shed while biting
Honey, this ain’t love, no
To the fact it ain't so frightening
On the taps your little feet in
Only
Back and forth but it’s too late and
On the road on which we're bleeding
All my body's undulating
Love, honey, this ain't love
How there hasn't been your pretty sight in
Strikes my heart and sheds some light on
It's raining cats and dogs and lightning
All this pain we're generating
We were born, born to fail
So much time, my teeth are whitening
There's no cure and no sedating
I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
This prolonged, insane, grotesque thing
A sundial for the gods
Love, honey, this ain’t love
