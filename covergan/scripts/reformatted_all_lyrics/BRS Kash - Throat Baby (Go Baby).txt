I go to war for you
Head monster, set an appointment
With a mouth like that, she can talk her way out goin' to jail
BOA head, make me cum instant
'Cause I'ma give it to her (What else?)
When she get hungry, she eat my semen
Balls and all, with her mouth, she clean it
Girl, I got plans for you, got a couple bands for you
Lovin' the, lovin' the mouth
Grip like pliers, I feel it tighten
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)
I like the stance on you, good mouth got me like, "Ooh, ah"
When we meet, I get excited
Sexy lil' redbone, yeah, got a good head on her
Sexy lil' redbone, yeah, I spend a bag on her
Ooh, ah-ah, ooh, ah, ah-ah
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
Money, I give it to her
Made a whole song, see, I ain't frontin'
Clock on rocks, I give it to her
She gon' blow and she gon' ride it
Suck me up for an hour, I can't help but buy you flowers
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Know what she came to do
With a mouth like that, if you go to jail, I'll pay your bail
Suck this dick, then she dip, ooh
Super good head, no cap, gown
Washing machine trick, ooh
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
I need you, wanna see you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you
Way too good, may buy you somethin'
I shoot the world for you
Damn, bae got me trippin'
She ain't even gotta ask for attention (Why?)
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
And I got beans you bite down
Extra lil' forty, gotta come right now
Since the first time, I been fiendin', couldn't even believe it
Got a lil' hundred, that's if you want it
No relations, feeling, fighting
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Head like that, shit, pussy, don't need it
My soul wet, need your anointing
Shawty got mean grip, ooh
