We levelin' up
Fuck you mean? Bitch, I'm Baby Keem
Lay you in the bed, bae, let's cuddle up, uh, yeah
My bitch need no effort, woah
I just took that nigga pack, won't give it back, ooh
We goin' for the re-up, you already know what that means
Just to get that pussy, I'm gon' lie to you
I'm gon' fuck this nigga bitch 'cause she got what I like, ooh
Straight to the curb, she headed, woah
I'm a young nigga, I'm irresponsible, ayy
Two-phone Baby Keem, fuck me if you want, ayy
What's your favorite color? Oh, that's mine too
Big money off in the desert, woah
She gon' play with the nana when she wake up (Bae, wake up!)
Yes, I like you, girl, I don't want to front
Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo
Had to run up in her, had her in the sprinter
She won't get a text back, I'm on ten and she mad, ayy
Offend you when I say it, I won't take it back
I heard your bitch wear Skechers, woah
Ayy, seven figures, she like seven figures
Diamonds do the Macarena, that's Fourth of July, ooh (Fourth of July!)
Morning, I chill with the plug, then we get up at night, ooh
He's not done yet, nigga
I got me a cheekbone fetish, woah
Who the fuck told you we was done, nigga?
Promised I won't tell it, woah
I just took that nigga bitch, I gave it back, ooh
Unapologetic, I run up the racks (I run up the racks)
Now she all on Twitter, claimin' I'm a nigga
We gon' have a good day, get your nails done
Nigga, meet me in Transylvania, nigga
Assist your ho, no pressure, woah
That made my smart bitch jealous, woah
