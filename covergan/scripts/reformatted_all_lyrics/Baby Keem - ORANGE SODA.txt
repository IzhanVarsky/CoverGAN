Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy (Ayy, pull up, ayy)
Six figs on the whip, that's a price tag
Messy, you my orange soda shorty
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Post on your block with your wish list on me
You let me beat it up, you let me practice
You want me be the man you can vent to?
You act like a lil' me, I wanna fuck you
I hate a bitch that I can't impress
You know I love it when you talk dirty
When you come see the crib, you better die, ho
Baby Keem, not a wave, I'm a vibe, ho
Now I'm finna lay you on the mattress
Young nigga sneakin' in through your side door
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that (Yeah)
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Seven fig nigga with the big drip on me (Yeah)
Lil' best friend bitch tried to press me
You the type to kill me, I won't touch you
My lil' baby low-key a flexer
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
I'm that underground nigga with the check, though
