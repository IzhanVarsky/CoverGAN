What's in your head, in your head?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah
Child is slowly taken
In your head, in your head, they are crying
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
We must be mistaken
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
When the violence causes silence
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
And the violence causes silence
Another head hangs lowly
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
Who are we mistaken?
Another mother's breaking
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
Heart is taking over
It's the same old theme in
In your head, in your head, they are dying
