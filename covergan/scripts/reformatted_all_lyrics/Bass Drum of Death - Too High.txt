I'll do it every time
Too high, too high
And if it drives me crazy
Every time I go down I end up instead
I'm alright now, I'm alright now
Now there's a letter open
Your deed don't cut they're just decoration
Woke up this morning with a splinter in my head
Been here a thousand times
Too many times I
Oooooh ahhhhhhh
Look in the mirror while I fumble for the key
I'm used to feeling faded
You've got me way too high
We're alright now, we're alright now
Well I turn around, I'm knocked down
They got me feeling dead
You've got champagne eyes when you're handing out lies
Put in a corner with the sharks and the fiends
I don't mind now, yea alright now
