I wanna be okay
Shut up, count your calories
Maybe I should try harder
They say beauty makes boys happy
You should lower your expectations
You should lower your beauty standards
I don't want to downplay my emotions
Wish I was like you
If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?
They say beauty is pain
I was never cut out for Prom Queen
Skin until my bones are showing
If you look a certain way
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body
Teach me how to be okay
I'm a defect surgical project
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks
You'll only be happy
Dissect my insecurities
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
If I'm pretty, will you like me?
It's getting hard to breathe
I've been starving myself, carving
I never look good in mom jeans
