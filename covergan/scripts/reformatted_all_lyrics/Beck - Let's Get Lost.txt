Let me come closer, i'm not your shadow
Let's get lost
It's not hard for us to say what we should not
Oooooh ooooooh oooooh
With our eyes shielding from the oncoming counts
Touch me i'm cold, unable to control
And tumbling tumbling, don't go fascination
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
Touch me i'm golden and wild as the wind blows
