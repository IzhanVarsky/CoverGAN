On the road to where we are
Somewhere in the city
Just to fight the lonely
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
I’d do it all again
Tried to change the old me
But you saw me from the start
Just held me back
Everything I did to get to you, ooh (Everything, everything)
You see the world that I see
All the hearts I ever held
I'll admit the fact that I
Changin’ almost broke me
All the times I thought I might’ve
I think I might've lost me
I did for you
‘Til it pointed me to you
Whoohoo, oooh (Everything, everything)
But somehow I’m intact
Chasin' love that was pointless
Put myself out on the line
But somehow I'm intact
I've been bruised and burned
You don't try to fix me
I’ve been bruised and burned
Reached the end
Settled for somebody
Everything I did for you
All the times I thought I might've
Done the worst I could do
I'd do it all again
Been the life of the party
