Go on friend
Anxiety, it’s just making me go low
Do you remember how I felt?
Its gonna come around the bend
I couldn’t find you, but then I found you, you were next to me all the time
Did you close your eyes? Did you close your eyes?
Remember you’re okay
You’re just lost and worried (Just lose and worried)
Did you wonder how it went?
It’s gonna come around the bend
I wonder why we feel alone?
Embrace the darkness (Embrace the darkness)
When you sing it goes away (Sing it goes away)
In this time of waking
Society, I don’t understand your goals
You must try to find yourself
But don’t hide, theres no shame (No shame)
When all I needed was your hand
The majority, they just stress while looking down their phones
With your spiral thinking
It’s gonna come around again (Come around again)
Cause when I asked you where you went
I try to handle it, its just never stops taking its toll on me
