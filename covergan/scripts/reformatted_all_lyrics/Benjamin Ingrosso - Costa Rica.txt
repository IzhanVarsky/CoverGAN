It's a dream, it ain't real, you don't care 'bout how I feel
Babe, you are lying to everyone
You are on your surfboard thinkin' life is so good
You can see nothin' else, only you and yourself
Saying you love being on your own
You know
(Babe, you are lying to everyone)
You fucking love la Costa Rica
Brrua
You fucking love la Costa Rica (Lalalalala, lala)
Life is so much more than spending nights on the beach
('Cause you got a new region everyday)
If you only can grow up, you'll wake up and see
Spendin' the days drinking tequila (Lalalalala, lala)
Spendin' the days drinking tequila
I want to go to Costa Rica
'Cause it makes you forget the real ya
So I can bring back my Linnea
Girl, you need to find yourself, but that place even helped?
But it makes you forget the real ya (Lalalalala, lala)
(Saying you love being on your own)
'Cause you got a new region everyday
Yeah
'Cause you lonely, ooh
(All of your friends telling you to stay)
All of your friends telling you to stay
I'm in London waiting for a phone call from you
You think you live the Pura Vida
But it makes you forget the real ya
