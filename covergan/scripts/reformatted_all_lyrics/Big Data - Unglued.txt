Coming unglued, ah
Never coming back down
I just wanna let you know
My eyes are out of view
That my body is about to blow
You and me
Here I come
The look on her face
Oh-ah (Yeah)
X, Y, Z
I'll go higher with you
I think I like it this way
My head is unscrewed
One, two, three
These are things that go together now
What do I need it for?
Never coming back
My tongue and my taste
Going all the way up
Must be going out of my mind
Leaving it all behind
Can't see them anymore
Yeah
I know what to do
They don’t know what to say
Can't see it anyway
Headed for a new space
Everything feels so unfamiliar
’Cause I'm going out of my mind
I gotta make a clean break
