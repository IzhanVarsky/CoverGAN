And live with my mistakes
Sin for me, cast away from it all
The color of your name
It spirals as I ache
With a scarlet cross
Hold onto me, and I can't let go
It's how they see you break
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross
Just keep on saving our goodbyes
The fear and the cost
Watching every letter fall
To find holy embrace
Will we live? Whеn we die?
I'm tied down to this chain
Stay with me, I'm afraid of my soul
Blackened and left in control
With the fear and the cost
My mind remains my pain
A symbol for my shame
Cannot be free and you can't deny
The end is coming, thе end is coming
The end is coming, the end is coming
Will we live? When we die?
