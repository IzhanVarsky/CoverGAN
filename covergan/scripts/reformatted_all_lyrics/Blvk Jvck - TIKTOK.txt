They pull up solo but left in a cop car
Drugs got 'em faded, these bitches got locked jaws
Like billboard, I been fucking with the big bucks
Ey, all my buddies came with me, now where the dimes at?
R-R-Riot at the sauce, boy, Steven
Buddies came with me, now where they dimes at?
She not that famous but she blowing up on Tik Tok
She hit the drink and she got loved thе way, she popping lot
She say she wanna have some fun, it's hard to find now
Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
She not that famous but she blowing up on TikTok
You acting shitty, I can't tell if you are up or not
All my buddies came with, I got BLVK JVCK
She hit the drink and she got loved the way, she popping lot
We got 'em sinking, they thinking, they rockstars
Hеadbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
See you hating, you can meet me at the tip top
Allstar, you fucking with allstar
Big bucks
Let's rewind that
W-Why you playing? I'm just tryna get behind that
Drip drop, I just blew it on a wrist watch
