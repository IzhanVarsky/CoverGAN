(It might be over soon, two two)
So I can speak into the silence
Caught daylight, goddamn right
And then I draw an ear on you
Within a rise there lies a scission
There isn't ceiling in our garden
There I find you marked in constellation (two, two)
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
And then You expelled all decision
(It might be over soon)
It might be over soon
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
As I may stand up with a vision
(All these years)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And if it's ever gonna happen
(It might be over soon) two, two
So as I'm standing at the station
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
