Listen and you'll never go away
I just wanna show you how to stay
Listen and you'll never go away (Go away)
Listen and you'll never go away (Go away, go away)
Leave it all escape so far away
In the glow of starry sky seven nights I would lie
I will never go away
Now I know wanna stay
If you ever want to lose control
In the moonlight hear the song
Hey, if you ever want to leave it all
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away
But I'll tell you how I see it now
I will never go away-ay-ay
And still listen all night long
Stay stay stay stay
Maybe then you'll think it is okay
Take the guitar and I'll tell you how
