I'll confess that I've spent years writing songs for cheers
No it can't, no it can't
Let's turn off the world turn it off again
The devil is in disguise and he's dealing out the dangers
We must stand, we must stand
It's one-side escape, either way leads
You can color me the flag, paint me red white and sad
To the girl, removing her heart with a coat-hanger
Re-set all the madness we've started to let in
Make a stand, make a stand
As he screams at the top of his thumbs and he fires this thoughts like a gun
Hang me up for the say it isn't true
Give 'em a hand, give 'em a hand
Take my hand, take my hand
Take a stand, take a stand
Is it fear disguised as power? Could it take the upper hand?
Where the rich don't supply and the poor drown
About love that might have gone wrong or a sad country song
Give a hand, give a hand
But there's something on my mind and it's cruel to act so blind
How the hell can you for a TV star to
You can laugh or you can cry but never can't comply
It's as if we exist in some compromised land
And he fills people with fear of the people who aren't from here
It's the only thing to do when they take the right to choose
