They never remember my order here
As much as I try
Too, too much time
Where people all dress the same
And prob’ly be right
Your love, I cannot outrun
And prove that you're fine
It’d all be the same
In the morning I fight my way out of bed
Down to that hip cafe
But after you'll check on my Instagram
Don't be a drag and say
So you could find someone new
And I'll be old
And you're sittin' on my couch
She’ll convince you you're over this
We don't have to start a war
Guess that makes twenty-one
Crying on the kitchen floor
And I sit here while you’re at the therapist
You know all I've got is time
And I'm sorry but sometimes you seem like one
And I wonder if that'd be the case for you
Pick up your feet when you walk away
Fate, it knocks upon my door
"Might be a chance"
Swear I could just disappear
And sit all alone
But I make it
There's twenty mosquitos in my house
Never can win
Reach out for the upper hand
Wrestle my foolish head
Don’t tiptoe around in my fragile mind
Maybe it's not healthy anymore
It’s just not healthy anymore
