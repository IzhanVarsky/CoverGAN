And the tall wind did break your home, roll, roll on
You have to help apologise for the sake of future days
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
Is all you're gonna do all
Do you think you can do, the people away to do it all?
When doing that was breaking home
Was rolling up, break the wall
All you're gonna do for all that you do
And when I'm coming home tonight
What have you done, free the night?
Save that money for a rainy day for the sake of future days
And the night you're losing, light down from your dreams
I'm coming home and away you go
You better have nothing for me, you better move year on your face
Within that breaking home
You're getting down, breaking your neck
Was breaking that break up home
For the sake of future days, said it's all for the sake of future days
To the all and all you go
I just think that room's to end, how commend them from your dreams?
You're spreading that lie, you know that
