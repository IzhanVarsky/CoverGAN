She's better off than she has ever been
It all seemed so easy
And she picks up all the pieces
Home, home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
'Til she did it on her own
She's going home
'Cause she's happy on her own
Baby, I'm home
There's so much she can teach me
Now she's made her peace with everything
Yeah, she's going home
She just does what she pleases
