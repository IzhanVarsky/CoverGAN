The Illuminati couldn't see me with they good eye
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (Nah-nah)
An open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers
Still in my bag like the fries at the bottom
I just want to really know how much that your shooter averages
I don't get no paper, I gotta sign at the bottom
I know the devil's a liar
My enemy lives in his mother's basement
I mean I'm only but I'm Motown
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus
I'm not no nice guy, I'm just the good guy
I was younger than I seemed as a kid
Fuck you, fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you
So I just hire a sitter
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy
Boy meets world, everybody been savages
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fuck you-ou-ou-ou
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
I mean my G in the head
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya
Fuck you, fuck you
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
I'm a real one
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier
Inherited the earth, popping wheelies on a big wheel
Fuck you, oh-oh
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu, fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die
Speaking of racist, fuck your microaggressions
Fuck you
I ain't no activist, I'm the protagonist
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer
And Rahm, you done, I'm expectin' resignation
I missed a Crain's interview, they tried leaking my addy
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, oh
Kingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (Yep)
The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it
I'm the real deal
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (No)
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols
I smelled my roses younger than the good die
The Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business
I don't co-captain it, I fly solo like one cup in the cabinet
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job
The bad guys should really stay on my good side
And I can't do nothing right, they gon' always be at me
