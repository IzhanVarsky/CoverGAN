A side yard, a side yard, inside bar, a dry bar
"What to get for my boy who has everything?"
Don't teach him 'bout Santa 'til you teach him 'bout Jesus
Man, West Chatham Park could use some better swings
Them the type of things I hate to bring up, just like the prenup
He never ring
But like the Christmas tape, there's things that I gotta get clear
It's been a minute since I've seen her
What in the world for the man who has everything?
Lost the cold hard cash, they said, "Damn, that boy soft"
I just need me some stockings
Tryna eat everything
Please, man, we needin' some freeze pops
Tell Santa to show up to doors he never ring
What's the point of gainin' chicken if it can't get across?
I guess I cleaned up, Santa don't miss no names but I miss Fatimah
I gave you free raps, that shit sound like free facts
I said, "I'll take anything but everything," you know?
Photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
Same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin' coin toss
Used to be disheveled, I went and shoveled everything
I'm tryna back up my baby mama like Kevin Federline
That's all I ask
Don't take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
Tryna turn Confederate flags into confetti strings
Like my papa ask the same question every year
I'm tired of people visitin', takin' the elevator
Real talk, I need a front yard, a backyard
Heard they got some nice-ass houses out there in Beverly
What's the point of gainin' chicken if you lose all the sauce?
That shit could get sticky like tree sap
That shit be see-through like John Cena, Aquafina
What to get the man who has everything?
Stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
Christmas cards so gorgeous, other families wanna frame one
Well, we'll keep the elevator
Don't gifts get re-wrapped?
Look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
That baby is a genius
And the chimney they could hang from
Nine cars and a garage, and it's on hella acres
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Never leave where I came from
I swear, it's enough leisure in this world to get lost
I was raised, it come across my plate, then I better swing
Which is 'bout as common as free blacks
Tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
And once the debris drops, the streets degrees hot
