But you got no reception
Always had me second guessing
Then the WiFi went
So many philosophies
Oh
I thought I learned my lesson
Open my door, you lost your keys
Oh that's a sign
Sometimes I wanna hold you
Late last night I was 'bout to send a text
I don't wanna be your ex
Yeah, I still miss our connection
Said you needed affection
Takes a lot for me to feel alone
If you were fucking with my best friend
This ain't fair but this is war
Sometimes I just
And you did it on your very own
I saw through clouds but now I don't
Couldn't handle all the off and on
Why you making me feel like I'm wrong
