Pockets always full of sunshine
Yeah, I got a Ayahuasca shaman, Hunter S. Thompson
Psychedelics on me, I don't even know where I'm headed
I got them mushroom caps and acid with Peyote for days
You don't got yours? It's cool, I got mine
Strung, holdin' in a dirty motel
Clouds in my reach, seeing birds-eye, coastin'
Got them psychedelic drugs leadin' my way
And Dr. Gonzo in the whip, my bih'
To infinity and beyond
High by the beach, up in the sky, floatin'
Acid, high-dosing
Shit
Gettin' high-igh-igh, yeah
I got that boost up in my aura and I'm feelin' myself
I got the drugs
Shit I got everything that you could even imagine
I got the drugs in the luggage at the Super , yeah
With Psilocybin inside of my potions
When the drugs hit hit, recline and get launched
Ooh, I got them psychedelic drugs leadin' my way
Drugs in the trunk, you need 'em, I got 'em
I got those micro-doses, macro-doses, I'm on a wave
Yo, got my third eye wide open
I got the drugs in a suitcase
Weed to the speed, believe I got options
I got that paraphernalia, riding off in the desert
I got medicine from Mescaline, Excedrin
Deep in the mountains, no one's
Mushroom eatin' in cabins, way out
Put your seat in the upright position, we gone
Woah, Webby Airlines takin' off
Even around us, gettin' high
