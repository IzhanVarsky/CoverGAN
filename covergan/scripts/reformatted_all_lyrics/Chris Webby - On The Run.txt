The pot's bubbling, my stock's doubling
'Til somebody give me a shot, won't stop shooting
Oh this hopeless prognosis make most just
Baby you gon' feel the temperature rise so keep running
Show 'em the truth, I'm through waiting
And they all a lap behind while I'm jogging
No forgiveness for my sins
Shoes hit the pavement and everything in view's for the taking
Running
Worked too hard for this, I'm not losing
I'm on the run, on the run
There wasn't a day since then I stopped hustling
I'm not slowing down
Stepping on the track to win the whole race
Merry-go, there he go, stereo sound
'Bout to burn this whole place to the ground
Only way to pass the time that I've gotten
When all my methods applied and they met their demise
No other option, they all watch it
No brakes
At my lowest still I stayed focused
I'm living on the run
Started at the bottom at hunger and got nothing
Told 'em I would get to the finish, I'm not bluffing
With a . with more rounds than a
It makes no difference on the run
Rock it
Hit the floor before I kick the door down
Make my living on the run
When I load up the chamber the whole place better
Hit with a boom, the room shaking
So large it's a miracle I'm here to show it
Moves that I make and the record's set soon that I'm breaking
Move it
How many points by now have I proven?
Bow
My evolution is not human
I'm on the run
Disregard traffic signs, I'm not stopping
Dead or alive I'ma get to thе prize
Hang it up, while I took loss and doses
'Cause I miss percent of shots I don't take
My competition bettеr go hide or get a disguise
No matter what lap I'm in, I won't wait
