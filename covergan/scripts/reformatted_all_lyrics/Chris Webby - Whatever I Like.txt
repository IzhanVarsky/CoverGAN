Cause that motherfucker can help you find me faster than my girl can
Between the economy, astrology, and bath salt zombies, I'm like
The shit is got me saying
Excuse me if I'm offending you, suck my dick my people is feelin' it
Somebody stepping to the kid is unlikely, so bite me
With grimy politicians and twisted Mayan predictions
Cause I watch my iPhone but I feel like my iPhone is watching me
America, home of the free, land of the brave
A dog in the rap game and still ain't got no bone thrown in my cage
Kids today are learning what they know from Wikipedia
Technology fucked us up, and Siri you're a fucking slut
Like trying to run a comb through the braids
Feminine feelings about my opinions just let me know that I'll be scarier
Tell me how they locking people up for bags of 'dro
And search to find the truth through all the bullshit that they feeding us
On attention medications cause I've been on em since I was seven
And honestly I gotta be a paranoid
And everybody on the street is on their phones like they don't give a damn
And take whatever pills the fucking doctor says you need in ya
Bitch I do whatever I like
Feeling is different now that I'm old enough to see right through the media
Proud to be American? Huh, yo fuck the government
The way this world turning is beyond me
I don’t give a fuck if you don’t like me
And kids are learning social skills from Facebook and Instagram
I'm in a whirl-wind, I wonder where the world went
The president ain't doing shit
Soon as I pick up a mic (soon as I pick up a mic)
I got no rules I'm not prohibited or limited
Generation RX, now I'm fucking dependent
With these words that I write (with these words that I write)
A fucking immature juvenile, only thing wrong is my age
I'm so fly my attitude will take you to a cruising altitude
Vicodin to ease the pain and steroids if you're feeling weak
Of a view that will show you how a falcon moves
The people making laws the biggest criminals on the globe
Webby back up in this bitch, running at the fucking lip
I'm like fuck it, let me just enjoy my time while I'm living
And you won’t sit you’ll see sick like the boat rocking on waves
So I light up a doobie and exhale, blowing smoke up in the sky
I do whatever I like (I do whatever I like)
Free style equal free speech; I thought this was America
While I'm looking at chemtrails
I'm at home on the stage, I fuck your head up
You’ll never find another motherfucker like me
And this world is fucking up, this world is fucking us
Now we need Adderall to wake up, an Ambien to sleep
And everybody knows, a fucking country is controlled by corporations, CEO's
