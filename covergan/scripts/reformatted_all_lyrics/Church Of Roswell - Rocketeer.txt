Just when we got comfortable (Ooh)
I hoped that I might find you here
We always were dysfunctional
This city like a wrecking ball (Ooh)
Good morning moon
Where did all my wishes go
I'm gonna fly
'Cause I'm so high
Just rolling through
Good morning stars
Good morning love
Heaven through my telescope (Ooh)
I'm feeling indestructible
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
Good morning god
And bring you back
To earth just like a souvenir (Ooh)
Nothing's gonna bring me down (Ooh)
Up like a rocketeer
CHORUS
Nothing's gonna bring me down
million light years away
I've been looking for
You had to leave
Out through the atmospher–µ
