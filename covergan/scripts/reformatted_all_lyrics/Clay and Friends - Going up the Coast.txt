I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
She answered, I know
To end up where it all began
Ain't got no saint to blame instead
With a view from my apartment
To get back to the beginning
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Off the tip of Argentina
Of my reflection, so I dreamt
When I knew why I was singing
Used to want to live in Brooklyn
No more homies on the block, like
I, and I plus five, heading Kanye West
On the coast they never lose it
I packed it all like Anderson
Never showed up for the showbiz
The last time we spoke
Better than drowning in gin
On the corner like a stoplight, yeah
This hard rive, gone save me
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Brown sugah, she called me
I was driving in a van, I was older than
Never homesick down that road
Pack my bag up, sick of home
