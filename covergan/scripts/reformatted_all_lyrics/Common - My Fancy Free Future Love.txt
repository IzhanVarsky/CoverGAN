Over and over again, no more holding it in
Background music either Anita or Ghostface
I was told God used rain to cleanse
That could be the start of our black clan like Spike Lee
Can't copy sex, still you can bite me
To understand part of me
Any time I get with you, it's a dope date
I'm beginning to understand and understand women
Written in the sky above, it's a higher love
Understand she gon' be like, "Nigga, just listen"
I probably couldn't have done this, years ago
We we-weather-weather the storm
You juicin'? Don't lose too much weight
You don't complain when I watch SportsCenter Top
Let's get gray, then we can die in love
Yeah, understand forgiving, understand commitment
You help me with my lines, tell me when my raps are wack
Use no stylist, you know I joke childish
Understand living in love with no division
That done changed 'cause of global warming
Red carpet looks I tell you when they coals
In you I got a friend, your kin is my kin
You are part of, da-na-na-na-na-na
I prayed for a woman, so I say amen
This is sparks of, no matter what they call it
Let's write a love story, we don't know where it end
So fancy free, 'cause I wanna be
Mind full of Gotti, Soulcycle for the body
Yeah, uh
A gift in my life that can't be boxed in
You a good DJ as long as you ain't blow
This is God's love, our love
Ooh–
That's the only time you really wanna fight me
Ooh– yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh– yeah
Ah, ah, new shoes, ah, ah, new clothes
You my partner, da-na-na-na-na-na
So fancy free, as I wanna be
When I'm sick you got remedies to battle back
Tell the first responders, this is a fire love
I love you this lifetime and after that
If it get ashy, we can start applying love
Depends on what you use for a lens
Your jellyfish theory we could master that
Love comes through and we get it on
My Gambino is black not Italian
You get spicy, any time I act like a Pisces
Let's watch ATL, drink wine, and order Postmates
So close, the future don't seem as distant
Really that glow is from your inner soul
They say it never rains in Californ'
Girl, in me, a King has risen
Relationship journey is spiritual, lyrical
We can work, we can laugh, we can cry in love
L-l-l-l-l-let's go on
Been through the PM just to see the dawn
Gratitude, to the Most High above
Your hero's Angela Davis, mine's is Ali
