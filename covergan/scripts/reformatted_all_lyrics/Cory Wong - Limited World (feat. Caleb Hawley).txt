Ain't it gonna be great
A little about what you came from
Change the world so fast
I don't want to be late
Ooh when you gonna learn
They be livin' in a limited world
When I lay it down
Chin up, take a seat
To the rhythm of the prison
And they ain't seen nothin'
Yeah... they went a little harder
(Scooby dooby doo)
Have it my way
Somewhere in that northern loop
What they've been missing
But you're gonna burn out
Took a trip to Minneapolis
They were playin' different rhythms
Oh it's not what you think
Straight up to the gate
Found a little bar
Run out of gas
(Yeah, we're pretty tight now)
Yeah!
Picked up my guitar
If you go too fast
Shoulda' never ever listened
(Cory Wong!)
Ooh now you're dropping' names
Listen up, turn around to the beat
Put your name on blast
When they read my name...
Ooh thought you were gonna
That fame don't last
I've got a plane to catch
Tryin' to make it last
Get up, take a seat
Shock 'em all so fast
Ooh said you never would
Time to make an escape
Uber man
Time to show this little town
But it felt a little different
Whatchu give ain't what you get
They were never gonna
Gonna show my attitude
Than I was used to
And they ain't seen nothin' yet
Take your time and learn
And you're gonna burn out
And they called it 'old school'
(Yeah man, check it out. I was hanging out with Cory Wong the other day)
