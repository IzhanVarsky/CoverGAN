Your sugar's too sweet to ignore
And it's a wonder I get anything done
I'll take on the world tomorrow 'cause
With your kind of love in my life
And when I go to bed
Better run if you don't plan on making something of yourself
Your love is shining all over my world
But I give in the minute you give me
All my troubles stay far away
And they get put to use instead
With kisses sweet you wake me
Before it's even begun
With the first tease of the sun
'Cause you're a sight for sleepy eyes
But my pillow never hit my head
And if they did I'd forfeit every dime to hear you say
Some loving on which to dwell
Before the sun even rises
And I'm gonna have my day made
You take all my naughty thoughts
And it feels like I've been dreaming
I'm taking off today
Maybe just five minutes more
'Cause it don't matter when you take me on
They don't pay me enough anyway
If it's between working or playing with you
You make me happy in the morning
You helpin me make up my mind
'Cause it don't matter if I miss the train
You make me wanna get up on the morning
I'm about to make the sun shine brighter in your day baby
