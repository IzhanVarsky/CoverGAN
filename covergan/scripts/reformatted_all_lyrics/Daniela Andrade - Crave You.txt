Oh I cannot solve
One moment I have you the next you are gone
I simply want him more because he looks the other way
I am craving you
This boy's got my head tied in knots with all his games
It's true I crave you
Let's just stop and think, before I lose face
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
A wave of heads did turn, or so I've been told
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
I try to reach out, but he's in his own world
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
Surely I can't fall, into a game of chase
My heart broke when I saw you kept your gaze controlled
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Yeah dripping in gold
Around his little finger, that boy has got me curled
Crave You
They stare at me while I stare at you
I walked into the room dripping in gold
They stare at me while I crave you
Or so I've been told
Dripping in gold
