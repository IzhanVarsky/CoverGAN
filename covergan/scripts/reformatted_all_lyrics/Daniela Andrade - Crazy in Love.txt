It's a funny thing for me to try to explain
Just how your love can do what no one else can
I touch on you more and more every time
Cause I know I don't understand
When I talk to my friends so quietly "Who he think he is?" look at what you've done to me
Got me looking so crazy right now your touch's
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
Oh oh oh oh
But baby I don't care
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Cause baby your love got the best of me
Cause I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no on else can
Got me hoping you save me right now
Got me looking so crazy in love
You got me going crazy
Got me looking so crazy right now
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
Baby you're making a fool of me
Lookin so crazy your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, my baby I'm not myself lately I'm foolish, I don't do this I've been playing myself
When you leave I'm beggin you not to go
Your love got me looking so crazy right now
Baby you got me
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
Call your name two, three times in a row
