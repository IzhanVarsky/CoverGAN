As you leave mid-conversation, so frustratеd
When you piece it all together
They're just fragments of imagination
You said it doesn't matter, but it bothers you
It's hard to forget what you never knew
Pulling the tulips up by the roots
With your hands up
Oh yeah
With your hands up, hands up
But I couldn't talk out loud
Well, I've had enough
Shaking off the dirt to get a look at you
Full-blown panic, you were howling at the moon
Yeah, well, I am
Hands up, hands up
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
I don't believe that look in your eye
As you leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
Leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
And I don't believe that look in your eye
Well, I've had еnough
With your hands up, hands up, woo
Clear desperation
Give me a reason to even try
The power to choose and the right to refuse
Yeah, so you can say that you've had enough
Throwing the heartache onto the flame
Saying nothing said it
And I feel frustration
I'm blacking out
Landing just where my body lay
