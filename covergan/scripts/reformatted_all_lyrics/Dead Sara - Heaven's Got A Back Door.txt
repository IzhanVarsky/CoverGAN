For the things that I can't choose
I've never been on the same sidewalk as a steeple
If I made it this far being who I am
May we take notice in regard to the unknown
A back door too
Heaven's got a back door through
To be gone
But I'll wake up to leaves on the ceiling
Heaven's got a back door too
So I sit and dwell on all the things I know are wrong
It's not your time to go and waste it
When will I stop running
I don't know whether to the press me farther or the people
And I'm running through
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
I'm through feeling sorry
I've never been your perfect song, your favorite daughter
Out of walls I heard the voices of the preacher
I don't wait, I don't wait for it
I've never been a perfect soul, oh
Telling me all the reasons why I'd die alone
From the things I know are true
Been wondering why you said
And it's all about your timing
