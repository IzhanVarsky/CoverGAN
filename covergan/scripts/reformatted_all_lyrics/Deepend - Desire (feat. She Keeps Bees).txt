Bless this house, bless my pillow
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
Desire, my long way
I will follow the sound of the owl
Sandpaper and gum, leaning and propped
Bless your pillow
Desire
The wrong way
Our arch undone, our arch undone
Lovingly
Desire, where you want to be?
To get rid of me, every single piece
