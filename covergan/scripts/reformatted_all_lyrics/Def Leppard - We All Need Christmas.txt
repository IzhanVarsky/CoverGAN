Open your heart and let love breathe, this Christmas
And may the light shine on you, and trust your hopes to see it through
Forever after let it be true, for me and you
So say a prayer to light the day, for those we've lost along the way
So here's to you, and all you do
We all need Christmas, we all need someone to need
Open your heart and let love breathe
Follow your heart, and let love lead, this Christmas
We all need Christmas, we all need love to succeed
They may be gone but, they still remain, in our hearts in our name
Ohh let it last
Let's raise a glass to all that's past, and to the future long may it last
