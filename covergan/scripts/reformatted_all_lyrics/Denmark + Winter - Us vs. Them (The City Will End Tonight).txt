We'll make it out alive
And it grows cold
I won't let you down (I won't let you down, won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down)
Bring me
I am whole again
Running
Gone
It's us against the world
Every slope
Sinking under
Bring me to life
The city will end tonight
Run out of time
Don't speak
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
Ohh-oh-oh
I'm a memory
Give me hope
The city will end
Take me now
It grows cold
Somehow we'll survive
It's not the time
It's almost gone
