Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
Iv'e been working so hard
And one thing I know is true
We gotta get out of this place
People tell me, "there ain't no use in trying"
For me and you
He's been working so hard
If it's the last thing we ever do
Watch his hair been turning gray
Cause there's a better life
In this dirty old part of the city
You'll be dead before your time is due
Wanna get away
If its the last thing we do
He's been working and slaving his life away
You'll be dead before your time is due......
I've been working so hard
Wanna get away, get away
If it's the last thing we do
Where the sun refuse to shine
Watch my daddy in bed and tired
'Cause there's a better life
