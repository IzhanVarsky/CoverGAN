I'm warm in sweet surrender
Yeah
Oh
In the eye of the storm, I forget what it means to feel down
Caught in a motion, 'round and 'round
I will settle
With your love, I will settle
And your arms are shelter
Out of the madness, we're alone now
You arms are shelter
You are all I know
Here in the silence, no sound
Your love
