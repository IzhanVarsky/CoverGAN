Waveforms reach through my mind
Their heads in the hills tonight
The reverb I feel, it signals to me
And when I see you again
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
The rattle of drums, the click of my thumb
Waveforms
Oh, you wanna know why
The rhythm machine through the smoke and the screen
I see it there in your eyes
And take me back there tonight
Lost in the clouds above
A long time ago, my heart was in two
Take it apart and break it, yeah
All these rivers run dry?
It's written in black and white
It's never been far from sight
Radar scanning my mind
Their eyes in the hills below
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
