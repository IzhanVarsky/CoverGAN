And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Girl, you know I want your love
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Last night you were in my room
We push and pull like a magnet do
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
And how your family is doing okay
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
Come, come on now, follow my lead
Come on, be my baby, come on
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
Come on now, follow my lead
One week in we let the story begin
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
And last night you were in my room
I'm in love with the shape of you
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
I may be crazy, don't mind me
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Although my heart is falling too
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Every day discovering something brand new
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
So the bar is where I go
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
We're going out on our first date
