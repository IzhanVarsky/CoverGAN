It's like I'm always doing something
Or maybe I'll pick up a pen
Of myself when I'm talking, of myself when I'm
I got a friend way back in London
And then I'll send it when I can
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Whenever I'm in town
Could be the whiskey or the drinking
But I should tell you, I love the sound
I got a friend but they don't like me
When I'll do better, to talk about
Oh, maybe we'll go out for breakfast
I try to visit when I can
Of myself when I'm talking
Oh, won't you tell me how your day is?
Or talk about it in our sleep
Anything that you want now
Well maybe I should bring her flowers
They don't like me like before
Oh, won't you tell me how you think?
And then I'll write her up a letter
But I don't listen anymore
