Asking who I’m seeing
Well
She likes green
Hair full of sequins (sequins)
Talking to Norwegians
I’m a Greek so she calls me Zeus
Let me tell you we got the juice
Even on a Sunday we still party while he’s preaching (ayyy)
And that’s alright I think
WIYULD WIYULD WHY WHY
And the heat makes the ice melt
It’s not my fault I’m super duper fly I just can’t help
I just can’t be modest (no)
I want a pyramid in Egypt
Feeling so angelic
You’re so overconfident and I’m intimated
Hispanics, Europeans
Aisle
We in the produce
She likes me in my Nikes
If I should ever die
I’m a goddess draped in velvet
Champagne in the deep end (deep end)
Hi-C got her loose
I think
Hold the door for her nicely
And I got people in my DMs
Yeah, that’s alright
And I’m the realest (I'm the realest)
Break the ice for my dime piece
WIYULD WIYULD WHY WHY (yuh yuh yuh)
That’s alright
Got a man or can I be him?
And I feel
Turn me to an ice cream
Head to toe in my nice things
Run it up like I’m running miles
Why are you so big headed
I party every weekend (weekend)
It’s alright to be jealous yuh
Spiral stairway to Heaven yuh
WIYULD WIYULD WHY
Well I’m hot
Line it up in that single file
AND I FEEL
Ew, Evann
I’m waking up on beaches (beaches)
How else would you expect my big, fat, juicy brain to fit into my skull?
I have to have a bit of a nugget as you can understand
Swear I must be fluent in the lines that I am speaking
Like a deep freeze
Lil Mop and I stay clean
AM to the PM
But I stay stone cold
