The breeze is slowly slowly coming through
Waiting
To blame myself for what
It doesn't notice me
Waiting for someone to answer
That's why I'm sitting here, letting the sounds of the TV
Am I the only one at home
Makes you weep
Sunny lights catch on the window
Do they all hate my company
But all I really really wanna do
Is send a pic and give it all to you
Missing the fun
Where did all these people go
White LCD
Rusty
Hey there's a beach
Collecting dust
Just get out and leave
Rusty old bike on the sidewalk
Mamma just wants us to get out
Taking our priorities
Drown out
The smiles on the screen
Mamma
Makes me bleed
As she gets up and leaves
Sunny
Have more fun without me
Scrolling up
Look at all those pretty shades of blue
