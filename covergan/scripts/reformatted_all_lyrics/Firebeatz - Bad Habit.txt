Except that no one else makes me feel the way you do
Bad bad habit baby
Didn’t you tell me that you were all along
And while there’s no one else makes me feel the way you do
It’s A.M who’s knocking at my door?
It’s a lady for you, boy, now I can’t take no more
It’s A.M who’s that ringing my phone?
Now I should hang up, after what you put me through
She says that you’re her man, that she came to take you home
Ah well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
But it’s your love that thrills me to no end
It’s a shame boy, but my heart is hooked on you
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
Baby it’s you
There’s no reason for me to talk to you
And baby it’s you
Well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
It’s you explaining why you don’t wanna be alone
