Losin' myself and my will to fight
I've come to know all good things come with my time
Stuck in a phase of bad habits I can't quit
Turned to pills to get high when the wine lost its taste
Down in the trenches at war with my mind
I feel like a prisoner doin' my time
Run out of faith and I can't see the light
To drift through the sadness and the meaningless haze
Keep fightin' the battle, the war with your mind
To the song your heart's singin' and you can't find the line
Lost in a maze that ain't got an exit
Behind bars of regret relivin' my crimes
When all of the colors faded to gray
I can't put my thumb on the hour or day
When your'e all out of reason and needin' a rhyme
