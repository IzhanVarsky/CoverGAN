Waves of gold as the door closes
I can hear the sirens (x)
I can hear the sirens
After the fire drove out the sparrows
Held back the flood, until the sky fell
Out in the darkness I saw an angel
I see the future covered in roses
Hey are you listening? I cannot reach you
All of the clouds hang like gallows
I'm on the other side, trying to break through
