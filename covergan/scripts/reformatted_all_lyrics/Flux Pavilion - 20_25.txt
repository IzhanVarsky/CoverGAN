It takes up time to pretend
You don’t have to fear at all
Let me be alone
I still don’t know what I want to do
Take a breath and beat ‘em all
You don’t have to fear no more
You don’t have fear no more
(Just want to be alone)
(I just want to be alone)
Where do we go at the end?
You don’t have to-
It’s okay to be alone
But I don’t know what I want to do
