Calling on you, belladonna
Now or never, no surrender
Until your flag goes black
Running from my enemy
Saints and sinners make good prisoners
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
How could you understand?
Now your king is dead
Kingdoms to defend
Under attack
Rain your armies down upon me
Crawling on my hands and knees
Now you're gone I float along
On your orders, bricks and mortar
Like embers in the air
Poison to prepare
Under attack again
March across my back
