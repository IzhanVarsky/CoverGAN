I am mad all about you
And you have got me high
You never know what you will find
I’m sick and tired of breathing in
I got secrets I can’t control
I need your love (x)
Call it drugs, call it caffeine
All your words have got my mind in a knot
Need your love (x)
Hidden lies between the lines
You’re loving and leaving
With all your loving and leaving
I need your love
But I’ll take a drag
Call it lust, call it sexy
But I’ve been falling down, down so hard
I still can’t stop thinking
Eat your love, girl I had to
Still can’t stop thinking
Just like seeds you know they’ll grow
I look sad, but I’m happy
Spandex, leather hat, no tattoos
All the other times
