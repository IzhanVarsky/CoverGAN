No, I’m not the man who does these dark things
Can't stop feeling that killjoy
To keep you alive
High off the fumes of this killjoy
It was mine to find
Trying not to smile
Oil and dust, blood and rust
I'll do what I can
And all in all I
Try to survive
To keep it alive
To protect with my life
I got a reputation as a killjoy
Twisting the knife
Either I'm the host, or in control
I'll do what I have to
Like watching the light
Hammer down, no more sound
Something in my blood that's unfamiliar
Can't take it it's mine
I watched the life leave his eyes
Killjoy
I do what I can
Leaving your eyes
Something inside me I think is drowning
Taking you home
Can't take it it’s mine
Salt the earth, prove your worth
Man, I'm so addicted to the killjoy
