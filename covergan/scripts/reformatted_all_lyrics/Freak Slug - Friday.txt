Friday night, she stays at home
She wanna tell me how she's getting on fine
But still lovе her with all of my heart
(Whatever she holds against me)
High, high
High
I don't think I'll be seeing her again
I'm sorry how I did
But I don't think me and you work anymore
So I could really be moving on
I love and hate her at the same time
I wanna get her out the mess she's in
Maybe onе day she'll listen what I've been saying
She's so lazy and I don't get why
Friday night, I watch her clean her room
But she don't ever wanna come to mine
I gotta close all the roads to her
She's looking to get me high
But I don't wanna make it long
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
