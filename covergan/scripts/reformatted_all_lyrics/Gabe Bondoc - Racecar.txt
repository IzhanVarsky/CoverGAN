That I can finally call you mine
Deep breath, she already said yes to you
You're such a race car
Chest out, I'm trying to go through everything
In this little car we've been sitting in
You keep knocking me out
'Cause you got everything I like
Just keep doubling down
Hoping by the end of tonight
This is as good as I've been
And just keep pushing it down
Night out, I feel the pressure pressing me
We talked through the rhythm and the blues tonight
I'll keep doubling down
Ooh-ooh
In this little car that you'll be sitting in
It's a two-way street
Hot mess, just look at what she does to you
'Cause you're a race car
Call you all mine (My little race car)
Racing away with my heart
In this car that we've been riding in
This is as good as I've ever been
That smile could light the whole city twice
Skin tight, those jeans are really killin' me
If you keep laughing out loud
Highlights, I'm staring but I'm listening
Eyes on the road, distracted
It's a two-way street where it's happenin'
I'll just be here on the ground
I'm as afraid as I've ever been
