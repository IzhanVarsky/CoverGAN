You're the one, you're the one
So I can see just who I am inside
It's in the way you look at me
Lovely as a ray of sun, the very first one
Who won't waste it, now
Forever this way because
The way my heart doesn't listen
You're the one for me
And girl I swear you're a godsend
You're my hero and my best friend
At the perfect height
To Him and to you
I only wanna take half
Faithful and true
You're the one, you're the one for me
And sway below our waists
And so it just keeps wishing
I will stay
Fit perfectly fine
Just as the day begins
Wishing you were close to me so that its beat
Your hand and mine
But I don't wanna take it
The way you smile so your eyes glow
The way you laugh with your mouth closed
And give the other half to somebody
You're the one for me, now
Will synchronize with yours
So I got a round trip ticket
