And I just it'll be alright
I see us on a boat out on this open sea
My dear best friend
We'll make this our heaven on earth
We'll open doors that we have yet to explore
It's a beautiful night so please don't fall asleep
And trust me
Can you see, everything you are?
A time when you're in the ground
Remember wherever you go
And so much more than what you are looking for
All the love that is in the pain
Wish you live your life in the best way
But there will come
It's easier on the heart
When the sun has set
There is no paradise
And I'll come
The stars are all we'll ever need
You'll soon be
When I think of you at some point in the day
Cause I just know it wil be alright
There're some things that only you know
Smile for me
Come with me
You and me, the seven seas
You'll see
So what is so wrong right now?
It's more than they can explain
