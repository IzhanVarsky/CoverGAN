Wonder have they always been there
Baby it's scary
Like telling you to fight a war
Cold against their palm
You're running now
Will they ever fall
First they tell you to walk
You gotta' just keep running on
Just keep running on, on, nevеr letting up
Just keep running on, on never letting up
Because I know we won't be here for long
Then they tell you to live a lie
Rising, above it all
I built you, palace in my thoughts
Then they tell you you're wrong
But I don't think that's where we below
Someone pulls the lock
Said there's no point in living now
They take you for a fool
But I don't think that's where we belong
Take away your reasons
I know that you'll carry me home
Wondering where to go
Without knowing the cause
Turn, turn it all into love
First they tell you to learn
Turning in your heart
Just keep running on
I know that you'll carry
If you want to live at all
Like a fly upon the wall
You follow them into their hearts
We aren't here at all
Fear is like a key inside you
You don't know where you are
Looking down on them
Just keep running on, on, nеver letting up
Then they tell you to crawl
Even if you could
