You're a slave to the rhythm, slave to the light
You can't give them somethin' they won't take
Somewhere to someone
They'll change your life
A gentle violence, they can take their turn
You light up the fire, they just watch it burn
We all belong
They'll make you mine
You won't know you're dreamin' until you're awake
And you know you gotta give it to 'em every night
