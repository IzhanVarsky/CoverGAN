And as I feel the sea beneath my knees
You know you got time
That was just so delicious (Uh)
Felt the wind at last
Couldn't feel my feet
Must have been about a half hour delay
It was my destiny to devour life like sweets and candy
And I was cruising up the highway
Till I couldn't breathe again (Till I couldn’t breathe again)
It was just so delicious, man
It was just so damn delicious
I could succumb or do it my way
But I'll let the waves come over me
My thoughts and conscience oceans deep
But I knew they were still dancing right beneath my knees
You know that feeling, right?
Oh, it's so good
Before my conscious mind
Recovered wings, took to the sky
That first taste
’Bout an hour passed
This trip, to fall would be defeat
I was a million miles away
Just delicious (Uh)
Just delicious
You know I gotta get some more of that, man (Uh)
