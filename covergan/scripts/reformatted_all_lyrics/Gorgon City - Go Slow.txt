We should let it show
Admit we're falling
'Cause I've done this before
Admit we’re falling, can’t help but let it show
Nothing ever felt this right, but I'm scared
On their own, just go slow, yeah
Admit we're falling, can’t help but let it show
Let's fall slowly, love
Go, go, we should let it go
And I don't wanna fuss or fight 'cause it's useless
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Can't get through the dark
And I don't wanna live life blind to the bruises
When two broken hearts
Let's not fall apart
Admit we're falling, can't help but let it show
And I know, I know
All things fall apart
I just wanna make sure that you're prepared
Go slow, we should take it slow
