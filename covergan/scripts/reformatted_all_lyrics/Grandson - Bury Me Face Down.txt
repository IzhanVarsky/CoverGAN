But I never sleep, gotta bury me six feet deep
Oh, I got troubles that won't let me be
Say goodnight, I'll never get free
Been counted out, left for dead
Bury me face down
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down
But now I'm done runnin', got another thing comin'
When I go (When I go)
Since I was a boy
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
It's only just begun
I've been on the run
I won't go quietly (Won't go quietly)
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But I won't get tired, set the town on fire
But somehow, someway, I'm-a keep movin' along, movin' along
There's a whole damn army thinkin' that they're gonna harm me
Oh, they gotta bury me
Oh, they gotta bury me (bury me)
Where the sun don't shine
I'm bringin' my crown (Bringin' my crown)
Into that ground (Into that ground)
From the rubble, what do I see?
And when I go into the ground (into that ground)
Watch my enemies get destroyed
'Till my troubles got trouble with me
Bury me face down (bury me face down)
When I go into the ground
But somehow, someway, I'ma keep movin' along, along
Thinkin' that they've won
I've been counted out, left for dead
Oh, I've got troubles of more than one kind
