The silent are damned
Cash another payment
Another politician bought
Heaven's sake
The body count is on your hands
Deregulate the casket
Money is the motive
It's murder on the campus
(The silent are damned)
I think I saw the reaper
'Til you get buried in the coffin that you make?
Will we all fall?
Watch history repeat
Can bring back what's no longer there
Turn off all the lights, nobody make a sound
No thoughts and no prayers
(We all fall down)
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
No prayers (no prayers)
Are we out of time?
The war is in the street
I swear I heard another shot
Red all on the canvas
(The body count is on your hands)
No thoughts, and no prayers
The suit is an accomplice
Can we turn this all around?
No thoughts, no prayers
Fear's good for profit
Another press conference
They wanna arm the teachers
Smile for the camera
(No thoughts, no prayers)
Bulletproof backpacks
It's a governmental shakedown
(Can bring back what's no longer there)
They lobby for the violence
How much will it take
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands (on your hands)
They're lyin' to the masses
Nothing gets accomplished
Welcome to my breakdown
