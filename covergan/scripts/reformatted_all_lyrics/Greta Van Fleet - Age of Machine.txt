Oh God, the feeling
Malfunctioned as it grew
Now you're free
We need some healing
Plugged in since the womb
You have been cheated
Heading on a course
Perfect child
Falling down on you
And the circuits blew
God knows if you feel defeated
For interstellar shores
Man has made
Unplug from the source
An omnipresent force
Prophet of the dune
In this electric tomb
God machine
No more underscores
Open up the doors
You have retreated
Feeling
