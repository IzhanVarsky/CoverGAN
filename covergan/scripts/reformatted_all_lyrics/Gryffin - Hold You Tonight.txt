All those plans you had
'Bout last night all day
Let me, let me hold you
Get up out of my mind
I'm gonna take my time
Can you be on your way?
Oh, 'cause this time
If you were here with me
And I've had a few drinks
Try to tell my friends what you do
And let me hold you tonight
Let me hold you tonight
You should use 'em
It sure hit a lot stronger, baby
Mmm, 'cause I ain't stop thinkin'
And it just feels right
Lipstick on the bottle
Oh, come on
You got my heart in your hands
So come and fall into my arms
You should lose 'em
Woah, no, no
Reminds me you were there
Mmm, are you up, or are you sleepin'?
Yeah, when it's late and I'm lonely
Woah, no
'Cause everything about you is better in real life
Make some new ones
That you left next to my bed
And come and fall into my arms
But it's too hard to describe
Please let me hold you tonight
Get up out of my head
The makeup on my pillow
I've got hours to give
All those clothes you're in
