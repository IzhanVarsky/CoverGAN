You, yeah, you, why you coming over here cold as ice?
Just good vibes, that's what I like (I like)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, good vibes
But you ain't on that high
But the sunshine, it feels like I deserve it
You, yeah, you, why you coming over here with your cloud?
I know life will never be perfect
I only want
Just good vibes, that's what I like
Be on your merry way
Why? Why? Boo-hoo, a little optimism can be so nice
I only want good vibes (Good vibes) 'round me tonight
Maybe, if you wasn't being so shady
No negativity in my life
So I don't you need you raining on my parade
Throwing shade
Throwing shade (Shade)
Oh, I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
Throwing venom everywhere daily
(Good, good, good vibes)
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
So I'm here with a brighter perspective
So I don't you need you raining (I don't) on my parade (Parade)
So I really ain't tryna be stressing, ooh
You, yeah, you, why you always trying to bring my mood down?
You could chill, you could hang
So I don't you need you raining on my parade (Parade)
