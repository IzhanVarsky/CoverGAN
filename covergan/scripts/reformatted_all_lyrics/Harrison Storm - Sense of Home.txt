Tell your brother you're going away
It's like something evil is taking a hold, nothing deep here
And you know he won't come around here
Tell your sister she is all you need
Tell your mother she is the only one, and your father has made you all that you've become
Tell your mother you're leaving here
But most times he just cries to himself
And your father has made you all that you've become
'Cause these words aren't meant for anyone else, but your family
Tell your mother she needs to reassess herself
It's like we're losing our sense of home
And this will be the only way
Tell your brother you're listening to his dreams
And his eyes won't see
For these words he won't come around here
Just disappear
Sometimes he tries to reassure himself
He needs it to be
That it's all still there
Sunk deep into his chair
