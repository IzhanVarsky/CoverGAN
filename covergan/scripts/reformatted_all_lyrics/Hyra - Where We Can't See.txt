Hold it, hold it
Be real, you liking where it’s going
You can back it up into me
Tearing my heart to smaller pieces
We could take it slowly
(Down, down, down, down)
We we can’t see, boy
Poisonous, it cuts down on me
Far from anything cruel
Here I lie, reminded of your kiss
Took me away to fantasy, oh
Lte me twist it down into the depths
I can hold it for a moment
Focus on us two
You could stick around as long as I’m there
Slipping further, ten meters deep
Hurt my reasoning
Seeped into my mind
And I’ll be sweet to you
The depths we you can’t see, boy
So intoxicated, I’m feeling a little weak, oh
Down, down
