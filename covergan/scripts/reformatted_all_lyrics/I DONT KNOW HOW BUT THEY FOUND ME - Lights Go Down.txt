Pardon me if I forget your name
Until the lights go down
Hello
Dance till the lights go down (Down, down, down, down, down)
Oh lord, the thief of the year!
Dressed like you're so uptown (Town, town, town, town, town)
And dance
Well, not every hollow is sleepy as this one
And we'll break our necks like we do when the lights go down
Until the lights go
Oh lord
Steal every heart from the boys that you're touching
Shake when you haunt me like you were a ghost town
Oh no, what have we here?
Parade through the ballrooms
It's curtains for you, join the back of the queue
Come now
But heads roll just the same
Somehow
(Oh lord, the thief of the year!) Until the lights go down
(Oh no, what have we here?) Until the lights go down
Decay in your costumes and dance
What a shame if you misspeak now
Corrupting the young with your uncivil tongue
(Steal every heart from the boys that you're touching) Until the lights go down
Is that any way to talk to me?
Down, down
