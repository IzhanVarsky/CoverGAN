To shelter me from the rain
I've been running away from problems
Even when I'm awake
I won't feel the pain
Would you let me
Why do I dream of you
Maybe if I just go to sleep
See some things straight
Because lately
When I know we were, just a mistake
Never knew it would be so hard
I knew I would keep
I can't see past my mistakes
Could you stand next to me?
But you cut too deep
