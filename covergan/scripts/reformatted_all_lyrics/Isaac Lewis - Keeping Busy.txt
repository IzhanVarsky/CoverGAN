The somethings wanna keep it where the passion is
I'll probably never, I don't wanna sever
The separation of our loving
How're you feeling? How're you keeping yourself busy?
(Tremor when you're waiting for a winner)
Hoping I can plan instead of hoping for the better
Every day, when I wake
If I can't keep, keep in touch now
Every day, I wish I could wake up to the sunlight creeping in
Are you keeping yourself busy?
It's all love, but I'll have priorities forever
Then I might lose the drive to make the art from pure expression
Every night, I become a fractal in the cloud that we're thinking through
I'm hoping by the summer we can gather all together
And forever isn't permanent, it's 'til I change my mеntal
In the night, I dim the lights
Until I get a chance to judge LA bеyond the weather
Don't forget the feeling of the tremor that we all felt coming
When the world spins again
But I can't have the neighbors watch me sleeping in
But keep me guessing, cuz if I learn the lesson
Cuz part of me is thinking all this madness is a catalyst
I create the window and I paint the view
