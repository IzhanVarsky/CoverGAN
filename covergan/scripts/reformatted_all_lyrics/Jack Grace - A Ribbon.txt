Said a prayer to get my hopes up
And oh here’s to nothing
Then you know I only wish that you were therе
Have you heard about it
But if you’re gone when I get off the road again
I want to call you call you, call you back
Verse
Chorus
When I’m out here on the wrong side of the road
For the modest cold suburbia we know
And oh, you’re a ribbon
They took another red brick dream
But thеy get twisted in the wind
Of the modest cold suburbia we know
Cause oh, I feel nothing
Was on the Northside driving in
I said a couple things that I regret
And oh I feel nothing
And that gets tangled in the wind
Of a modest cold suburbia we know
How we lost someone
