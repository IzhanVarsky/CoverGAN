Was it worth it all? Could it be more?
We can't get any higher, we can't get past Messiah
No one man's a island, shotgun ridin' for ya
And, oh, what a way to die
So we came forward, runnin' backwards
Somehow we made it, although jaded
Overdosin', at least I'm with my baby
Was it worth it all? Could it bе more?
We came forward, runnin' backwards
Somеhow we made it, although jaded
Pretendin' we're alive as we grow colder
And, oh, the devil that I know is better than the devil that I don't
Standin' eye to eye
But we're still chasin' for that feeling
