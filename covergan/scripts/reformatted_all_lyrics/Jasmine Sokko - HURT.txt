The things that pull me down
And I like your honesty
I just
I know you know my weakness
Spilling words
So I came to you to cry about
Like haze getting
See I wish I was calm
So I guess there's glitch in transaction
Hurt you back
I just (hurt you back)
But I just need somebody (need somebody)
Poisons darts right of my chest (right of my chest)
Baby, I am sorry
I know I'm kind of selfish
Yeah, I know how we are
You said you meant me well with your affection
I just want to hurt you back
Haven't been doing good for a while
Some kind of miscalculation
Of apology, 'cause that is free
But you didn't have to rub it in right now to remind me
I just, I just, I just, I just
So I guess there's a glitch in transaction
But I didn't think I need affection
But you blame it on insecurities (insecurities)
You see, I know, I know
