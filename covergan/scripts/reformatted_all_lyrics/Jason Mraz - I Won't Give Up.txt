I won't give up on us
No, I won't give up
And who I am
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
It's like watching the night sky
Even if the skies get rough
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough enough
When I look into your eyes
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
How old is your soul?
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
We got a lot to learn
I'm giving you all my love
To be right where you are
And just like them old stars
To do some navigating
Well, there's so much they hold
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)
I'm still looking up
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
And when you're needing your space
'Cause even the stars, they burn
God knows we're worth it
I see that you've come so far
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
Some even fall to the earth
