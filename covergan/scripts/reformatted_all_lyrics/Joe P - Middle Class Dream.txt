Safe from it all
I'm the suburbs, she's the city where you're living
Right through my bones
I'm just a fly on the wall and I see it all
The cold blows through my window
Find shelter, take cover from me
You stay dry all year
In the backseat of your fresh car
In the movie, you're the love scene where the camera shows you nothing
And don't you wonder why it never rains anymore?
I'm her first time, I bet he won't know what that's like
I bet you don't know what that's like
God I wish I know what that's like
We're living a middle-class dream
And don't you wonder how this doesn't hurt like before?
Where the streetlights never light up that's where we'd come, I bet he won't know what that's like
And he's the champagne and your headache that you can't shake
But if you let me, I could blend into the background every weekend
Right past my eyes
The sunshine comes through my blinds
We're stuck in our middle-class dream
I'd be a fly on the wall
