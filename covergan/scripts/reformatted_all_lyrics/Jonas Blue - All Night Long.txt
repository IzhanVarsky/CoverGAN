Catch a feeling, carry on
Free falling
I, know that I love it when we're high
Slow down, yeah
Lately I been thinking 'bout the way you looked at me
Keep believing, carry on, on, on, on
And I won't leave
Look at me
Even though we're strangers in the dark, you're all I need
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
