At least we're dying together
Up, down, I'm so insane from what you've put me through
At least weâ€™re dying together
You come over just to break up
Somethin' 'bout you, I'm a addict
And change our minds like the weather
I've tried too many times, too many times, yeah
I-I-I-I got no control, I'd rather die than let you (Go)
Hate you, I need you, we're so problematic, yeah
(Verse )
Damn these bipolar hearts always feelin' too much
But shit, it's taking forever
I-I-I-I got no control, I roll the dice and risk it all
I've tried so many times, I just can't get enough
But if this love's gonna kill us
They say that time makes it better
Then wake up wearing my sweater
I-I-I-I got not control, I'd rather die than let you go
We fall in love like the summer
Leave you 'til I forget how bad you fucked me up
Oh well, I think you made me crazier than you
