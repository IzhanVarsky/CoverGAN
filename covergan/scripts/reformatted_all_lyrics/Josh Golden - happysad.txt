Most times you would cry out your make up
I'm happy, I’m happy, happiest when I'm sad
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I’m sad
Keeping up with you, it was toxic (Yeah)
Lost a lot of friends just to keep ya
My parents hated ya more than all the drugs (Yeah)
I miss us living on your couch
Make love, still drunk when we wake up
And I don't like the way it feels
I like you most in the madness (Yeah)
The secrets I still never tell
Maybe we were cursed, maybe we were magic
'Cause I know how much you love
Summertime, every night we would break up
Never left the house, we was always stuck
I've been sober for a minute now
I heard you moved home, hope you're doing better
The stupid shit we fight about
To cry out your name
Getting high off your sister's pills
It ain't real if it's average, yeah
I'm on a stairway to Heaven
So you found a nice guy? Hate to see you settle (Yeah)
Missing the way you give me hell
It's only good when it’s tragic
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad
I’m happy, I'm happy, happiest when I’m sad (Yeah)
Still bad that we stopped it
