Had 'em high hopes, now I'm losin' my faith (Faith, yeah)
Mixin' things, we shouldn't be
'Til heaven come, don't you fall asleep
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Do or die, you and I, we'll try everything
That's my fucking girl, we them crazy types
Psychadelic love, dancing through the night
'Til heaven come, it's you and me
Head up to the floor and I got no brakes (Brakes)
Smoke it 'til it's gone, nothing goes to waste (Waste)
Double up the dose (Double up the dose)
Let's go for a ride
Pedal to the floor and I got no brakes (Brakes)
'Til heaven comes
Found our broken hearts, lost our fucking minds
My faith (Yeah), but baby
'Til heaven come
Waste away the days, burn away the nights
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Push me to the edge, I know what you like
Double up the dose, let's go for a ride
You're my favorite drug, you're my favorite high
Empty fantasies, yeah, feed your appetite
