I miss the drunken nights with you (Yeah)
But it's useless 'cause the truth is
I loved you, I loved you, honest
Fake another smile and just wonder why
Bottle up our emotions
Your love is all that I wanted
'Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna see you
How we danced to Tiny Dancer all around your room
Never knew what I could lose (Uh)
All this time without you got me stuck in lying games
That I loved you, I loved you, honest
I hope that you still remember
Thinkin' that I'm gonna text you
I keep lying to myself that it's better this way
Until I spent a month without you
I keep lying to your friends, saying I'm doing great
Damn it, girl, it hurts my pride (Uh)
Staying in every night (Uh)
We had to jump to assumptions
I'm scared that you don't miss me
That you're gonna read it and not reply
I don't know how I can stop it
After all this time, you still don't miss me
I hate not being around you, what did we prove?
I should've tried to change your mind
