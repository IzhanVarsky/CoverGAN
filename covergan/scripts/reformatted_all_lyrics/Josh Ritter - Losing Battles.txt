Most times, it’s a losing battle
He held the notes like rock 'n roll
By the time the fever broke
Spent the night on the face of the earth
Without a friend till the day I met you
I’d had enough of trouble
I saw it on Rio Bravo
Fell into a den of thieves
Lost man singing for his soul
I had enough of pain and bad will
Fed it on my sins and apples
She was trying to be free
Sometimes the righteous win
I kept it in a box of wood
Tried to do the things I should
There was nothing to forgive her
Born again into lost belief
I turned my face to the world of shadows
Got lost in the caves of virtue
That's when trouble spoke
Swam naked in the mythic lake
Lost my heart to a girl of silver
From the apple tree, I ripped a snake
It was poison but I knew of its worth
I gave up my only twin
Drifted down to Tennessee
Now I'm trying to mend my ways
Sometimes, it's a losing battle
And told his tale to Colorado
Good enough for you someday
Blame the maker but stay with me
Till then, it's a losing battle
It's always been in my nature to be the beast
