Before the towers fell
You were a man of noble esteem
Older in the doorway
To see your eyes all black
Where I held you underneath
When the muddy rockets flew
I was a man of noble esteem
My burnt and bony knees
At the bottom of the hill
Along your soft skin torn
I was a man of high renown
All round the light said
Cover you in petrol and tires
The rush all down your back
That kiss all your limbs
I dreamt we were in hell
Cover me in elephant
The dusty garage floor
Under the sun beams
Where the goats are on patrol
And the sisters I had too
I'll bury you here
All round the dark said
Older in the roses
Bury me here under the sweet grass
Cover me in elephant oil
That sticks to your thighs
I'll bury you here under the sweet grass
Younger in the roses
