You told me the other day
And away you fly
How crazy and amazing you are and then let it inside
'Cause you never let up the fight
But I won't agree when you tell me you don't deserve a life
In the pain
They told you it's clinical, but I seem so critical
I hope you see someday that you are beautiful anyway
You walk with your head held so low
And you never gave in on those days
You can be scientific
That's what makes this life so wonderfully awesome
Singin' hallelujah, I'm known and loved
Singin' I'm here for a reason
Free with your head held so high
You look in the mirror
There you go
I wish I could convince the thoughts
You hate yourself and anxiety
Take a second and breathe in
You'd open up and open wide with a smile
Most the days and that's okay
And horribly awful
Depressed, a mess to death
That you keep on believing were a lie
Feeling so broken and alone
Trust me, know I get it
Raise your hands
Please try to see it clearer
You wanna give in
Yet somehow, it's beautiful anyway
