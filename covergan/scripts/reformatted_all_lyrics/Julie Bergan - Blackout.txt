Right out of my head
I need a, I need a, I need a
Wrap it up, seal it up
Won't take this anymore
This is how I want it
Already lost me, I'm outta here
Gonna switch you off
Get out of my mind, yeah)
(Right out of my head)
I know you know it
It came to show
Throw it out the window now
You were too caught up
(I'll leave it behind, out of my mind
It's how I want it
This is how we do it, now
Pack up, move on, forget
(Erase and rewind, out of my mind
Out of my head and thoughts
It's how we do it
I've had enough now
There's so much talking, but I don't care
Blackout
We had it all, but
This is how I want it, now
This is how we do it now
In your ego
(Pack up, move on, forget)
Look where it started
This is how we do it
