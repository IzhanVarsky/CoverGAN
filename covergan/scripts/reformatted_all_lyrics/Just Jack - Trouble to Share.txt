Are you filling in a crossword, or are you whittling a chess set
You got trouble to share (Low)
Twenty-eight days later (Ooh)
I'm getting lost in the red tones (Yeah)
I got nothing but time
Because I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth
And I'm getting worried about you
I got nothing but time (Nowhere)
I'm not going nowhere
I'm not going nowhere (If you're feeling)
About everything that's going on with you anyway
'Cause I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth (Call me up)
Or are you hiding from the neighbours (Neighbours)
Call me up (Call me up) if you're feeling low (Yeah)
I'm not going nowhere (Call me up)
Steady waiting by the bat phone
I've been here on my Jack Jones
Call me up if you're feeling low
I'm never going nowhere (Going nowhere)
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind (I'm not going nowhere)
How you dealing with the distance (Distance)
It never seemed to be the right time
I'm never going nowhere (I'm not going)
Call me up (Call me up), give me a piece of your mind
I'm never going nowhere
And everything I could have told you
Now it's forgotten like a cold brew
Call me up (If you're feeling low) if you're feeling low
So many people trying to kill time
You got trouble to share
Only another ghost in a ghost town
I keep thinking of the old you
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind
I can't believe it's not dead yet
Another world in my headphones (Yeah)
I'm never going nowhere (I'm not going nowhere)
