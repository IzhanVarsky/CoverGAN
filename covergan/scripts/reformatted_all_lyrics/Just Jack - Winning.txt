Room like an old black spinning
In a friend of a friend’s house
Even if you find that you’re a clone
Trying to keep the wolves at bay
Fools are staying for the winter
Even if you’re basically alone
Everything I’ve ever done or seen
Ain’t it good to know you’re alive and willing
Even if you find yourself alone
Ain’t it good to know you’re alive and winning
Riding on a snow white stallion singing
Hardly a hint of the aftermath
Feeling like the night was day
Room like a star-spangled galaxy spinning
Suger-coated shell with the heartbreak filling
Money never knows it’s history
Moon like a silver medallion swinging
Buying what we sell we can all make a killing
Money never knows where it’s been
Of everything I’ve ever done or seen
Fell in love with it in summer
Don’t ever wipe that smile off your mouth
Even if you’re basically a clone
Just walking around with a white moustache
