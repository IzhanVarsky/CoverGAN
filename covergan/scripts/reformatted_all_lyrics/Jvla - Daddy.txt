You'll beg me for it
Lil shawty way too hot
Body rarri, yeah, a couple thousand on it
Diablo in love, god I love that body
(baby, turn me on)
Yo necesito malo
Spilled a thousand on my motherfucking new jeans
I just let her play on top
You ruined many of them, I'm just one too many
Fendi, gucci and dior
Coke on gucci, sort on gucci
Ah, honey, Hani, ah, hadi, hard it up
All these hundreds, hundred thousand heartbeats
Zara, claro
Te quiero, mi pecado
Damn, I'll blow up, owned a two-seat (coupe)
Hoe, haha
Yes, fold it, hoe, girl I want it all
I'm addicted to your pussy
Squeeze-in your belly
Now you'd do anything, for me
All the good shit on me
Turn your daddy on, burn the way you want
One touch and you'll forfeit
Night you'll never forget
(Bitch)
I know you're a baddie
On and on and on, on and on it, yeah
Mami soy el diablo
Baby I ain't got no plot
I'm just trynna fuck you, mami
Aye, just walk, own the shit
