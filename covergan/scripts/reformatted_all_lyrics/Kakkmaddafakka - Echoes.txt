They got no friend in me
I can hear the echoes when I sleep at night
'Cause I'm no saint
Baby, I'm guilty
I still hear the echoes
I should leave
I guess we're never meant to be
Read me my rights
Ocean eyes, clear blue sky
To their eyes
Wrong she did at the time
You should stay
Baby, I'm guilty...
Prove to those with spite
(Echo, echo, echo, echo)
Don't let go
I see the signs, but they are sticking through the silence
Guilt-free
When I open up the window
Can't predict which way the wind blows
That I can bring tears
The rain keeps me indoor
Echo, echo, echo, echo...
Guilt-free, guilt-free
Told me 'bout her life
I got enemies
'Cause baby I'm guilty
That how she missed being in this arms
But she's in pain
Oh wait, oh wait
Show them one more time
