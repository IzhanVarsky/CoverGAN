Keep on talking, self-conscious but it’s not gonna show
Wade in the water on your own, don’t wanna go home
Nod at the locals, knowing that we’re not going to stay
And we’re walking, palms are sweating, our hands let go
Tried to climb one, countryside activities
Don’t make a sound
And we’re walking, talk about The Galapagos
And we’re walking, car parked in the shade of the trees
Leave clothes and shoes on the ground, don’t make a sound
Natural science, erosion, eruption and us
And we’re walking, a woman and her dog look away
