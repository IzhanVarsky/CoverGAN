But tonight I can't help giving you all my attention
Naked in the blue
I'm cold and freezing
And you look nice and warm
And me, I guess I never revealed my intention
My life has been a snowstorm
Navigation isn't easy
Down at the local bar
Swimming naked with you
And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
Music plays from the local star's guitar
But I'm with you and you're ordering a double
Joked around through ups and downs
Me and you and only water
You tell me you're a wandering star
There's a climate change
Adventure into space
You say you're leaving this place
You look at me differently today
I say don't go too far
Since we were fifteen you've been hanging around
My best friends told me I should stay out of trouble
