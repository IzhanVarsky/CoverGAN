What do you wanna get away from now
I guess that, I’m only real in my head
When your daddy’s got money?
And make the fucking hell right now
We lived miles apart
I was hoping I’d find myself
Think I can feel my legs shake
(wanna be lucky, wanna be lucky)
And I held you in my arms
With a pocket full of dynamite
I was hoping I’d
I think I can feel my legs shake
Yeah she’s a rich little girl
I used to drive down to you
Go on, make the fucking hell
When that addy was the topic
(kid brunswick)
What d’you wanna get away from?
As you took it all from me
(mmmm)
She's oh, so, lucky
They were oh so funny
Oh right now
I was hoping I’d find myself;
Don’t take me away from this feeling now
Make the fucking hell shape
Fuck, Off
You just wanna be lucky
That’s why I need these narcotics
What the fuck you want?
Hoping I’d
Do you remember those days?
(ooooh)
But waves kept coming
I could call you my honey
We just wanna be lucky
Have you got a reason to be sad
Well, you held my hand
Brand new baby, born at
She better keep runnin’
When the tears came running
But we don’t wanna be saved
Yeah
When I could call you my babe
‘Cos she’s a rich little girl
Make the fucking hell right now
And she’s oh so lucky
But you don’t wanna be saved
I’m brand new baby
We’re just young, numb and broke
And you took my money
