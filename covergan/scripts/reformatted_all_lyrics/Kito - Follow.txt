Down with the vibes and you know I got you
Yeah, there's just one thing I need the most
If the money get low, low, low
If you lead, I'ma follow
Way down, way down
Do whatever we want to, I would
I follow you, follow you, follow you
Let's turn the lights down, oh-oh
Follow you, follow you, follow you (Oh, tell)
Alone for the ride and I'm bumpin' with the beat, yeah
Give me all that body, I need you close, close
Somewhere we go
Stay around, stay around
Doing everything close, close, close
Follow you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
High in the sky and I feel like I got wings again
It's all on you, follow you, follow you
Stay with me 'til tomorrow
Somewhere we could
Can't keep my eyes off you
