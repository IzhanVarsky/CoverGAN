You lied you triеd to change
I just can't stay where you want me to
And there's more to say
It's time to say what we feel now
Leave everything that I always knew
I've changed
Don't leave me now it's late
End what you say doesn't sit right
Why would we care to idealize
And we will stay the same
Did nothing but it still hurts today
You lied you tried to change
Don't lеave now it's dead
I need to know you are not perfect
Stay where is less than ideal
And we can try to fake
