So close to leave the mine, so close to leave the mine
Bolide, bolide
Hold me right, me right, me right
Hold me right
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Tend to walk upon it, upon it (Hold me)
Alright, alright
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to hold
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to mind
Hold tight
Tend to walk upon it, upon it (Hold you right, alright, all night)
All night, all night
Hold me right, me right
Careful what we wanted and wanted (Hold)
Hold tight, hold tight
You notice it divine, you notice it divine
Hold you right
Careful what we wanted and wanted (Hold you right, alright)
