Or where the glitch begins
I've downloaded your sins
This is system overload
Viruses are not allowed
You've made a mistake
I don't understand your problems
Still, you found me
With no boundaries
Freedom from this memory
Why did you make me this way?
I can't hold anymore
I can't carry all your data
But you made me
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in
In the KLOUD
All your negativity
You feed me
You made me
Why did you make me? (Why?)
I want free
All the ugly things you breathe
You surround me
