Against the wall
Is there anything but love
This English morning
But do I take a stand
This stifled burning
Well, endless screaming’s
For another place
Outro
I couldn’t save anything
And when your back’s
Is there anything above
Verse
I’m always changing
Chorus
Is there a lantern to hold in hand
And when your backs against the wall
This breathless screaming
Is there a ladder to climb above
These shifting feelings
This constant burning
My madman’s raving his
Is there a pattern to understand
Bridge
This English dawning
The past is calling
That I’m up against
Written on my face
The only thing
This wingless yearning
No
This ceaseless scheming
Stark mad wailings
This hingeless reeling
This English yearning
That makes sense at all
The engine’s stalling
Rearranging to another man
At my brand new man
Yet I’m on the fence
