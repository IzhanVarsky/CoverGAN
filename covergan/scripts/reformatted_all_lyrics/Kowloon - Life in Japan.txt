Thinking “the world I come from
The perfect bend
Across the bay
I marched to work
Behind the latest lens
Steetlights speed by
Is your heart beating
I saw you there in the crush
Speakers blared out
And does it even matter
I pour my sake
Pound like the rain
Arithmetic has gone backwards
All that I know
This could be something”
Can't stand the thought of
Throwing up again
Through crowds in Thatcher Squarе
Can we make it
Its what we wanted to be
This could be something
And recognize nothing at all
Life in Japan
Down the drain
Can we shake it
Is lost beneath the waves”
Drifting though a town I know
Thinking this could be nothing or
Ain’t what I thought it would be
Life in japan
I feel my heart
Don’t ever change
This could be
Is behind us
First call to prayer
In the end
Train car is lurching
And your eyes are sparkling
Your smile’s got the
I’m home
And just starеd
Thinking “this could nothing or
Ain't what I thought it would be
The faces in the seats
Or pretend
Nothing adds up at all
Like the days
