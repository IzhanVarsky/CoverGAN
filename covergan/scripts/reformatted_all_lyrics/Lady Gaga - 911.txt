My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Please patch the line, please patch the line
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Need a , can you patch the line?
Front I've built around my oasis
Pop, pop another one (Ooh)
Almost like I have no choice
I have heard enough of these voices
Keep myself in beautiful places
Pop a , then pop another one (Ooh)
Paradise is in my hands
My biggest enemy is me, pop a
My mood's shifting to manic places
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again
This is biological stasis
I can't see me cry
Turnin' up emotional faders
Pop a , then pop another one
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)
Holdin' on so tight to this status
