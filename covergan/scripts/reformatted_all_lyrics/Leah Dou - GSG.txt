This house is cold when I need you most
But I never liked to talk about this before
Two years coming now I’m older
Things can be so penetrating when you’re constantly waiting for something to happen
Humoring them big folks thick folks sick folks
Checking out the scene
Used to try to be the nice guy
And I’m bopping to this dream
Shy guy Shy guy
Fashionably early to the party
A coconut mountain (right, alright, alright, yeah, alright, alright)
Sometimes when I close my eyes I see
IG Twitter Facebook Tinder wave at me
'Cause all I really see are black holes before me
Through the coconut trees
Same scenes playing over and over before me
Wake up in the morning and I think of you
I got lotus by my side
Wondering if you ever think about me too
tatted on my shoulder
It’s the freak show king show biz show
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
Loner
Live the right life
A coconut mountain
I see lotus running wild
Looking for some loving
Opportunity yearning
Apocalyptic season (yeah, yeah, you know me)
Being charged of pleasing (yeah, you know me)
'Cause all I really see are circles before me
Sometimes when I open my eyes I see
'Cause all I really see are mad men and palm trees
That’s the name homie Oddi gave to me
Like something significant
Skid wimp soul kid in green
A coconut mountain (ay)
