Can't get over shit I'm done
I get high but can't escape
Wanna die 'cause I relate
Wanna cry I feel insane
I just need some fucking space
I've been dying all along
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
I walk by I feel them hate
I feel colder every day
Soon I'm dead I cannot wait
I'll be gone I'll be okay
I just really can not stay
Wanna die when I look back
I've been hurting for so long
Now they want me out their way
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm so tired of this life
Ion really have a place call my home now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
I'll be gone bitch pass the blunt
Tears are falling down my face
Wanna die so fucking bad
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
I just make another song
Baby take me from this place
Nothing helps I'm fucking numb
Baby kill me in your thoughts
Would they love me If I change?
When it's time just let me die
Let me go where I belong
Am I lost? Am I too late?
I've got so much shit to say
Please don't love me it's a waste
Give me pills and let me vibe
Get me drunk bitch, get me high
You're the best I've ever had
Cause you always made me sad
