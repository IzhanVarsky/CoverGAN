I don't have cold feet but it’s hard to read you, babe
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap
We drive down the wrong street on the right day
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
Picture us nude on Sunday afternoons
My love’s dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap
My love, my love, my love is dirt (The sweeter the love)
Oh, I know I'm a beast, but you're the perfect creature
Can we take the next step? Too many red lights
I love you whole, you're like gold to me
And is there a time limit on how long I get to keep ya?
My love’s dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
Is it too rude? Just picture us nude
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap (The sweeter the love)
Are we turning left? And are we feeling right?
With you, I feel the difference when you are away
You wanna roll a spliff but it's the middle of the day
Happy with a view (Hehe-oh!)
Scrabble in my room (Hahaha!)
Was it too rude to just allude?
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
Oh, I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap
I love you whole, you’re like gold to me
