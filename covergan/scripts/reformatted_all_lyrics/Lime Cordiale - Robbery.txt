Still got her lipstick on my cheek
We started speakin', a-small talkin'
And I can barely sleep
Hey, I'll never know
She got her lipstick on my cheek
I found a diamond in the darkest mine
I turned around, she vanished in a blink
Mm, yeah
She left her lipstick on my cheek
I guess I'll never, I'll never know
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I guess I'll never, yeah, I'll never know
I've got a fever, a cold sweatin'
Hey, there's been a robbery
Mm, I'll never know
A-tiptoe over the borderline
I put up wanted signs
I guess I'll never, hey, I'll never know
She vanished in a blink
A-ciggies fillin' up the ashtray
I put up wanted signs, hey
She hauntin' me and I can barely sleep
I'm lookin' for⁠— Wait, that's her, stop that girl
Empty-handed, right where you left me
She stole my heart and then took off on me
Another weekend, a new story
Yeah, wait, that's her, stop that girl, hahaha
It's hard to make it through the day today
I said hey, there's been a robbery
