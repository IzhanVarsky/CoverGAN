I guess I'll be here 'til July
Keepin' hope alive despite the darkest storm
But the thought of us can make the time go by
While we don't have all the answers
We could walk, but in a garden
We could talk while at the market
We still know what truly matters
Takin' moments of our days to be alone
Yeah, the thought of us can make the time go by
The days are driftin' slowly by
I find it hard to have no answers
Mm-mm-mm-mm
