And when I wake up
You're such a mystery
Got everyone looking as you walk away
Yeah let's think about it, wish about it drink upon it, link upon it babe. We can talk about it, love around can find it eh. When we with an answer jumping on to your confession got me a rushing, crushing, hushing, blushing, , your touch
You are you lovely
And I can't lie I only tell the truth
That you effortlessly
Your style
You are so lovely
BRIDGE
Pull off on a day
Oh
Can you even try to see?
I can't shut it off
There's something about you
I can't get enough
That you effortlessly pull off on a day
As you walk away
VERSE
And when I try to stop
The things
I'm begging please
OUTRO
Got everyone looking
And in my head I love
RAP
What do i do?
CHORUS
There's nothing that I'd change about you
Through and through
Of all that you do
When will you finally get the clue
Had you in my grasp but you're too slippery
Thinking back I guess we don't have history
