You and I don't belong in a place like this
You're not alright, I'm not alright
And every high got low with no one to blame
And I don’t remember all of my mistakes
You like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
So don't let me go
Baby, let's roll
No point in keeping the score
XO
What a rush and I don't want to let go
Let's roll
We don't need to believe everything they think
You're not alright, I’m not alright
You say you’re sorry, but don’t know what you're sorry for, no
I'm imperfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
When I'm high in the shade and I’m feelin' a way
And when our hearts aren't broken, they're out of place
Got no patience, conversation drivin' you up the wall
I've been perfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
You’re not alright, I'm not alright
I like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And you don't remember all of your mistakes
You say you're sorry, but don't know what you're sorry for, no
No, don't let me go
Gotta fight for the love
And I don't remember all of my mistakes
Baby, hello
When it's all so, uh
Headed down that road and you don't gotta go down solo
I just wanted to see if your plans ever change
You're my XO
And when our hearts aren't broke, they're out of place
