No responsibilities, just running wild on empty streets
Young and wild and reckless, we were trying to change the world
Two shots and a beer was just enough to get us drunk (Hey!)
Now every cold December
But I know these memories never die
Now I know these memories never die
The time I used to call you mine
I wrote you letters to remember
Dancing to the radio, listening to our favorite songs
The summer days, no lonely nights
Do our memories ever die?
I think about the way you dressed
Singing along all the lyrics to "All Summer Long" (Hey!)
Yeah, now I know our memories never die
But do memories ever die?
Met you by the ocean, near the stand we got our alcohol
And if you ask me then I say, "It's the best it ever was"
I think about the day you left
I wish I took a photograph
Walking down the shore, falling asleep to endless evening talks
