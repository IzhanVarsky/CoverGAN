To make me lose my mind
And the air gets thin
And my mind's racing
Feel the heat increase
When we combine, feel the satisfaction
I'll do anything, make you feel alright
Feel the beat of my heart
Nice and slow
We are just two of a kind
First a look, then a spark from a second
When we make contact
Tell me what you want, boy
And I need to feel your skin on mine
It's a physical-chemical interaction
It's a chain reaction
When we combine feel the satisfaction
Honey, all the time
You got me so distracted thinking of you
Baby, your touch is more than enough
When you make contact with me
We can take our time
I can barely breathe
Got me weak in the knees
When we make contact boy
Deep inside my soul
I can kiss you right there
