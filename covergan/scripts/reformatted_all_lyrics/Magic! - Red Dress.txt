And she knows it’s getting late
Cause we’ve been working overtime
I said hey you with the red dress on
Hey you with the red dress on
"Finish up your plate"
But when we finally get home later
You
And I’m staring at the time
But I’ve been on my best behavior
It’s hard to concentrate
She wants to make a night that we’ll remember
Thinking it’s alright, put on whatever
She whispers to me
And I said hey you with the red dress on
Knows that I’ve been waiting and I’m starving
Pacing back and forth
You in that red dress
But I’ve got one thing on my mind
And it consumes me
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
Not to cause a scene
And ten thousand lifetimes later
When she walks through the door, I say...
She’s tried on everything
Everything little thing inside her closet
It’s just you and me, and I say
You with that red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
As they pour the wine
When I see you with your red dress on
