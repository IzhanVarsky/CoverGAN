Sulking on the dance floor
Saw you in the back
Sulking on thе dance floor
Got me in a mood dancing by myself
Between the tracks I look at you
You were with somebody else
I started moving closer
Had the look in your eyes that said:
To see what was lost
Then I felt my body, separate
Then a song came on, and the pain was gone
I choosе death, not forgiveness
I saw it walk itself to the pit
I choose death, not forgiveness
My eyes roll to meet my lovers
"Don't talk to me"
