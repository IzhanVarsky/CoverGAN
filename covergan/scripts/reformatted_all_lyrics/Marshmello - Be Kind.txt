You can be kind to the one that you love
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
And close your eyes to the one
Wanna believe, wanna believe
Always confide in the one
It's not fair
I know you need, I know you need
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah
I will stay by your side every night
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
Ah, ah
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
When you know you can cry to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
I know you're built to love, but broken down, so just try, yeah
Already told you I'm right here
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Ah
I don't know why you hide from the one
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
