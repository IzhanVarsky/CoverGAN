Far away from the wreck we made
'Cause with all that has happened
When we see what we've become
I want to see you smile but
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
Well, it's eating me up inside
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Not the fire that we've begun
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
When the evening falls
I wanna raise your spirits
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Then only for a minute
And the image of you being with someone else
Even though I might not like this
So I'll go, I'll go
When the morning comes
I want to change my mind
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
And I'm left there with my thoughts
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
I will go, go, go
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
Know that means I'll have to leave
Every argument, every word we can't take back
