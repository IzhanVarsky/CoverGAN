And sometimes we fall in love with people at the wrong time
I'm tired of doing it on my own
Sometimes, it's okay, baby (yeah)
And now I'm stuck here thinking what it could be
And, baby, just please don't go without me
And now I'm stuck here thinking what we could be
(You and me)
Doing it on my own
Doing, doing, doing it on my own
You and me
