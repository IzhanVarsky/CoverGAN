You know it’s cold, cold, cold
That I crave
As the rain starts to pour
'Cause the heating’s on
It’s getting light again
Should be over
How it makes you smile
Just what I need to get by
As it continues to unfurl
And start to define
Crumpled up in a coat
Ephemeral
Like how you feel when indoors
And I’m not looking for sympathy
Is way beyond my day to day
I just need these little things
And you’re nice and warm
The cost of the feeling
It’s these little things
That you’ve not worn in a while
But I’d still pay
Or when you find a bank note
From all the bad in the world
As I shield my eyes
In frozen with those little things
And I’m not looking for simile
You know it’s gold, gold, gold
I’m lost in the bread aisle
But still enough to change my mind
That make my mood swing
