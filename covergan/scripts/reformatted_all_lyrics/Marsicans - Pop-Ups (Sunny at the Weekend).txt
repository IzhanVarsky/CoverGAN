I can always find another scape goat
I've got a way you can go far
If you feel you can't come unstuck
No sign of wrinkles on your face
If you wanna buy a speedboat
Someone who follows endlessly
And the at the divings well
You'll always be falling when you ring your friends
That's just the kinda thing I do
Be very quick, don't leave a trace
I got a secret, wanna hear it?
So listen up and we can start
You should wait for it to pile up
And it'll always be sunny at the weekend
Turn to cold, oxidising you
A clear path through crowded room
If you wanna live the high life
I'll make you money, make your dreams come true
Then come on down and follow me
Live happy ever after when the world ends
Oh, the ride you had to
When the simply stands high
Take the
Realise you haven't thrown in a line
A way for us to never a have to quit
After a month you'll sail right through
Just sign right up and chasing the flashing lights
