You'll spend an hour trying to get your fairy lights to turn on
I've been asking myself questions
All the pieces fit
But it's worth it
You are, are-re-re-re
Like: "Are you worth it?"
Oh, it's worth it
We're a puzzle in our own way
To slip right under all your wonder
Too good, too good
It's a shame I'm no wordsmith
Too good, too good to believe
I shut my ears and face my fears
Stuck in a world where it all seems
You got me caught in a dream
Figure where your heart is
Sunk my battleship
Tried preparing interjections
Well, you've won
We spend our lives wishing that our love would long live on
We gotta work for it, we gotta work for it
Well, I'm sure
Because I've started
You peeled the stickers off my Rubik's Cube
