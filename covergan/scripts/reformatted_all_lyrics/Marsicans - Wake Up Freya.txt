Be shaped by the things that you love
And I can't blame you, I know it's hard to make sense of life
To wake up Freya, you're new to this world
So what would I tell you, if I knew it all?
I've looked around me and I open your eyes
You'll move everyone to tears, you'll find its a whirlwind when you're here
You'll be living for dreams until they're fulfilled
Don't worry about things you couldn't care less for
Where do I begin? You'll be confused and cry
You'll see things aren't perfect and find that your time will fly
And I'd tell you this again if I could
Just try your best to rise above
Not what you learn or the people you meet or the joy that you bring
So wake up Freya, a new little girl
In someone else's structure that we're just here to build
It's calm round here, a family of pearls surround you
Wake up Freya, ah
