And I'll regret it (All if)
And everyone's fallen into all these nine-to-fives
And if I do you'll have to save me
So if I take the plunge
That I am not overwhelmed
And soon they'll all be having babies
All my friends
They're changing and they're rearranging all parts of their lives
I can't (Seem to) get myself together
Well the years pass by
If things don't look better in your eyes, your eyes
Try soaking up the scenery hoping I'm a sponge
I tried to convince myself
Your eyes, your eyes
Does everybody think I'm crazy?
And everyone I know is growing up and old so fast
The paths are chosen, and they're known that they might never end
Notoriously porous, I might get soaked up by the sun
While all my plans are blurred and hazy
If things don't look better in your eyes
Am I the only one who wants to make this feeling last
Are running out of time to mess around and play pretend
Well the years just pass
