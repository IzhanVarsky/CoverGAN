It's what I got inside me
You know it don't work that way
I'll keep on singin' for you
'Cause that's what lifers do
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
Or running to you
You know it don't change a thing
Ain't nothing gonna separate us
I would not change a thing, yeah
Whatever might come my way
(My lungs are breathin')
It's hard-wired
I know you're gonna be with me
No matter where I go
Not gonna stop, I'll still be singin' for you
Would not, would not change a thing, yeah
(I'm gonna keep on singin' for you)
I just can't seem to shake it
(My heart is beatin')
I'll still be singin' for you
'Cause it ain't what happens to me
And my lungs are breathin'
And as long as my heart is beatin'
(I'm a lifer for life)
It ain't like
No matter the high or low
If it's pushing you away, yeah
(You call me home)
You still love me the same, yeah
I'm a lifer for life
(Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right)
And now, ladies and gentlemen
Like choosing when to breathe
(Woo hoo hoo)
(Before I was created)
And before I was created
Even right through the moment
I can just walk away
Even if I could, yeah
When you call me home, yeah
Living inside of me
I'm a lifer
No, I'm not gonna stop
Yeah, that don't define me
You already knew, yeah
What I, what I got inside me
(Right through the moment)
Hallelujah
As long as my heart is beatin'
