Call up girls that live in my hometown
It didn't make a difference
To help fill up the minutes
I wish Tracy Chapman was my friend
Beginnings always hide themselves in ends
At some point, I will be okay
I know I got to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
Move on (Move on), move on
She would know exactly what to say
Everyone just wants to disappear
Lit a match and saged my house down
But I have to, yeah, I have to
I got high when I met you
So I got high when I met you
I feel pain, I don't want to
I got high to forget you
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Went to see some shaman in Malay
Everyone just wants to feel good
To hear some things I wanted to hear
