But you show up in everything that I do (Do)
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad
I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van
Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
But you show up in everything that I do
All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans
I don't wanna write no song about you (You)
I don't wanna write no song about you
Yeah, yeah
Now it's a cold war, who will call first?
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back
Try to be productive at work, I just can't
Put all your stuff in a box in my room (Room)
I miss you a lot, but I ain't comin' back
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Everything that makes me feel confined
You know, you know exactly how I feel
And these memories of us, it's brutal
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I think I miss somethin' I never had
And your side of the bed still smells like you though
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
Sometimes I hate sunshine
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Ayy, ayy)
