I was looking for exits and I had far too many friends
I gave up my grudges and paid back all my loans
Get the word to all my good-time friends
So I packed up my suitcase
Then I went walking through the rhododendron flowers
The yoke of this harlequin world will break you to pieces someday
Let’s go walking through the rhododendron flowers
The fishing was fine but fishing comes to an end
You know the way it gets
You fools in your cities
I threw away my phone
I’m coming down the mountain
I was up to my elbows
Looking for white robes but the prophet won’t be found
Isn’t it lovely above the madding crowd?
I traded my trimmings
Think you got it made
I told you I loved you, I just had to leave you alone
I’m coming down the mountain again
For a white cotton robe
Got me a fishing pole and it’s been ten years now
Coming down the mountain again
And you’ll go walking through the rhododendron flowers
But I’m coming down the mountain again
