And you say
You're all I need
The records on
It's the only way
You explained it all to me today then ran away
It's like sunshine and I feel fine
I can't believe
Come this way before you find what is left
Then you run away
I need you on the phone all alone
Then you ran away
(I can't believe)
You want it all the time
You forgot the thing that matters to me most
My mind
The records on and you say
It's alright with me I'm fine it's okay
