I would rather disappear
I'm okay, well, maybe not
'Cause everything's in black and white
You'll be fine, I say it again
So I'll explain the best I can
And I can't say I'm numb inside
It sucks
So I breathe, am I gonna drown?
(Here it comes again)
So I breathe, will it ever end?
It's like I'm floating in a blacked out sky
'Cause that just sounds so dark
It's like I'm colorblind (It's like I'm colorblind)
Uh, let me try
It's hard
It's... I don't know, it's...
Except for mine
We're fighting off a constant fear
Slow down
Than face the world outside
'Cause even as we're sitting here
That something doesn't feel right (Feel right)
I should let someone know
Maybe when I'm better
You think you're okay, but then you're not
No, it's...
I can't, I can't really...
'Cause even as I'm sitting here
'Cause everybody's world's in color
But no one sees that part
I know you wanna understand
You'll be fine, I say it out loud
I can't really just explain it
I'm floating in a fallen sky
What this pain feels like
