But then you're on your own
And you feel so strange
Don't you wish you were invisible ? (Don't you wish you were
And you ain't got nothing to prove
And no one's gonna judge you
Likе you're a mistake
And no one's gonna judge
Like you're a mistake
Everything bringing you down
And you can't take no more
Invisible ?)
Don't you wish you were invisible ?
I been screaming in my loneliness
You can be whoever you want
When you walk at the door
Every morning feels like yesterday
But everything bringing you down
Put a smile on your sad face
Trying to find love and happiness
And they look at you strange
And you try to bе strong
So you just turn around but sometimes
Still be here but hidden to the world
