I was waiting out the wonder
The truth is gonna find me
I’ve spent too much time
(Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
(Jumping into the deep end)
Hands in the air I’m jumping in
I’m gonna learn
There
I’m done runnin ' from it
Know the truth is right behind me
Oh, the truth is gonna find me
The answer’s in reflection
I’m rising up
Won’t let the wait take me under
Ahh, ahh
Got to, got to, sink into the feeling (Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
(Get to know it, get to know it)
I’m gon' get to know it (Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
Keep it by my side
Before you can rise
Get to know it
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
It’s a friendly fight (Friendly fight)
