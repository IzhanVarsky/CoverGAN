More than somethin'
You meant somethin' to me
Spinning in my head
But not to forgot you baby
I'm not gonna run away, no-no
I should have known
Givin' you this space
Learn to love what's left
I'm not gonna
Cause i'm too tired to fight it
Like we never knew, love
Iâ€™m not gonna run away from our love
So ready to move on
To let you go
All i've got to say is stuck
Dream my heart
Been tryin' to
I'm done, i'm not gonna pretend
I'm not gonna run away
Still makes me smile
Drive me insane
Look the other way
It'd be this hard
I'm not gonna run away, no
The little things
And i'm not gonna hide it
