Still purpose circles like a dancer
In love there's a light
Far from all the worry that defines you
There's love where it's right
Using the truth to let go
Tying myself down with all I find
My spirit is with the breeze
To live in truth
Far from the things I used to know
But in my mind
I found the strength that I found it
Serenity rests in me
Tired but searching for the answers
I found the strength to let it show
I smile cause I know that it's okay
I've got this love to help me slip away
The truth is in love
Wild and free
