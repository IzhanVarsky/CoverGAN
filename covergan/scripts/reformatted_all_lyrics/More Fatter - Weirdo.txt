Still a party if my body's movin' all alone
Right and left
Records broken, jump in motion
(Can't hеlp it)
Ohh
Shake it all around
Shake it up
(Can't help it)
Lemme make it clear to you
(I'm just a weirdo and so are you)
What to do?
Ohhh ohh ohh
Shake it down, baby
They're always asking
I go stupid for you
Time for me to quit the masking
Lemme make it clеar to you
(Get with it)
Just thought I would let you know
Just be cool, act a fool
Caught your eyes in the firelight
(All alone, all alone, all alone)
Ohhh
I'm not joking
I am a weirdo
(x)
Don't you get it
Shaking in my bones
