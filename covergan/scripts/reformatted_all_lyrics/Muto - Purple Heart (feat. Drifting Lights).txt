I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart (Ah)
How could I be so kind?
In an effort to keep the conversation (Conversation)
It’s taken it’s toll
I was high at the time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
I’ve never been so (Oh) tired
Though it sounds like somethin’ I’d say
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart
Though it sounds like somethin’ like I’d say
Woke up, had been asleep for days
And I surrender my heart
How could I be so blind? (Oh)
In an effort to keep the conversation
Find myself in the strangest place (place)
In the back of a stranger’s car
A happily trashed mind, we’re goin’ back to the grind
I can’t remember where I left my mind
In an effort to keep the conversation (Ah)
I’ve never been so tired (Tired, hey)
I’m maxed out like my credit card
(I’ve never been so tired)
I’ve never been so tired (Tired)
This world keeps unfolding
