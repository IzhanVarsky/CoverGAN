What's with all this blood stain?
Oh, I wanna find all my old fairytales and
Wish I could take back every moment that I
If my gums gon' taste like copper
Oh you should bring me candy and go away
You should bring me candy
Well I guess it's time I put me first
(Chorus)
Least I should get sugar cane
Verse :
Then I would turn this car around
Drive to where we first met
Lеast I should get sugar
Because you kinda blew it up
Cause I still haven't learned how
And rip the pages out
And we could play who's hurting worse
And punch you in the mouth
Cause I got nothing else to do now
If you're gonna leave me sour
Oh if love was so sweet and easy
Well did you hear about my universe?
If I could put my life into a verse
Least I should get sugar
And you can never let me down
You should bring me flowers
Cause if you're gonna leave me bitter
If you'rе gonna leave me sour
Ever gave a fuck
All I think about is you with her
