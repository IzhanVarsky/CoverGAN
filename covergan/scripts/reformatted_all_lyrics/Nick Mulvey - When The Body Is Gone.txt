Death for you, like slipping off a tight shoe
When your life is a song
Rising from the sea with a rain cloud
Death is perfectly safe
Oh my little seed are you afraid
Is when you can be
With the coming of the shade?
Where will you be?
To fall once more
Because death, death is perfectly safe
Sing on, sing on
Where will I go
Plunging as a tear into a river of a light divine
When the body is gone
Only the truth is the case
So long, so long
Death, death is perfectly safe
For sure
Free
Youâ€™re made
