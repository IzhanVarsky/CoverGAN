And this is for all those dreams I believed in
But at least I found a home inside my head
Ain't it sweet to be someone
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we're, we living in
I miss the honesty of pain
I ain't no different from the rest
I won't let anyone so wrong tell me what's right
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive
So I guess it's just the world we'll have to blame
Take your last breath to mend the fall
'Cause this is for all those lies I believed in
(I'll be just fine)
This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me that I ain't fine
I'm just a sailor swimming backwards
I might be jaded and delusional
This is for all those dreams I believed in
I'm just a liar who got lucky
I'll be just fine
I'm just a preacher in the graveyard
Telling everyone but God to follow me
I'm just a fish out in the sea
Point your fingers like a gun
I miss the permanence of failure
This is the last damn thing that I hold close to me
But I sever ties with all my anger
