Los feliz
Rosary
Come with mะต
Maybe it's me
Say goodbye
Fall asleep
'Cause everyone is feeling it
In my place
Pacing in my work shoes
Say goodnight
A passive attack
Found a way
In the deep
Is the call not enough?
Everything was running smooth
Is holding me back
But I don't believe
In its place
Close your eyes
Take your old
Can't you see
Everything was lit brilliantly
I was lost
Say a prayer
Just terrible luck
The champagne was off
Something in my memory
All is well
Everything is sat perfectly
I can't keep up
