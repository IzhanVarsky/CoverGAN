'Cause I can't play these games with you no more
Baby, I hope that you understand
It's just that I can feel I'm falling deep
I need to know from you right now before I go
So if you love me, just say so, just say so
Just say, "La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
So if you love me, just say so, can you just say so?
So I'm trying my best not to overreact
I need to know if this is really real
And I just don't wanna waste any more time
Then baby, let me know
And if this love isn't what you want
And if you feel the same way that I feel
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more, oh-woah
Mmm, mmm
So if you love me, just say so, then just say so
Ooh, mmm, mmm
If you love me, just say so, then just say so
I don't wanna go but I'll walk out that door, oh, woah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
So if you love me, just say so
It's getting hard for me to hold my own
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"
But I need to know right now, no lies, just facts
See, nobody wants to be in love alone
This is for my peace of mind
And I don't wanna fall unless you're falling with me
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more (Oh)
Oh, oh-woah-oh
