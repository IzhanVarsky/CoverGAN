We've been up all night for two weeks
Got me paranoid, caught up in the feels
Tell me what you think about me
Let me try to make you the one, I could be that man, let's go
(When you're out there, you just wanna have fun)
I can feel her body asking me to give her everything
I don't even know if this shit is real
She got me sweatin', don't know what the hell is wrong with me
Got me so drunk on the thought of your touch
But playing with you, baby, just ain't enough
'Cause baby, I'm not looking for a "ten night stand"
I wanna feel like it's all or nothing now
I wanna know I make you feel like that
I wanna fall and never once look back
'Cause I know she knows we've got the finest chemistry
So can we fall and never once look back?
I've been staring into these sheets
So can you say that you want it all?
Wondering if I got what you need
I wanna make this the start of something
I came for your body, but I stay for the vibe
'Cause I know she knows that we can't let it go to waste
And I don't wanna think that I'm just a crush
When you're out there, you just wanna have fun
And I don't wanna think that it's you on the run
'Cause I don't wanna leave it alone with a "ten night stand"
