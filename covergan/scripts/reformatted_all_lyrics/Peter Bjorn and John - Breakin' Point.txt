I saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
On the couch, hypnotized
We've been eagerly awaiting your entr√©e
In the quest of what it's worthwhile or just trite
Saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
I've been waiting for your kick to set me free
We're running on empty, I leave it all in your hands
Got it from whiskey like any loser can
All the trivialities are out of focus in my mind
I'm listening to you
It's a small step for humanity, a giant step for me
Now show me what you do
You've been hiding in the bosom of my dream
Listening to you
What to do? What to say?
Been running on empty, I leave it all in your hands
Now the clock sets the scene
Stay inside with your doubts
We're running on empty, leave it all in your hands
All I really wish is you'll be doing fine
I'm listening
In the European late October night
Now show me what to do
