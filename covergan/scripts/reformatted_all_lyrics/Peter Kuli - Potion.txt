When I'm falling out of love
Take your tears back, I don't need your problems
Get rid of your fear
I think you should give me faster calling than I'm after
Babe I be your potion, when you cry
Until you resolve them, get the fuck out my past
You give me pressure like the walls inside my head
I won't fight your demons for you
You keep talking on my ear, dear
When you find me swimming across your ocean
All of these voices that are warm inside my bed
