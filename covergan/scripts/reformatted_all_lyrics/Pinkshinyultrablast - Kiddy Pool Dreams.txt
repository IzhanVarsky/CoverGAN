Down through the valley and almond grove
Soothe me, come into my dream and stay
The curly washed capes and strips of land
The hazy mountains are up above
Guess I'm wrestling to make up my mind
The ocean's glimmering surface
Bind thoughts, oh, there are so few
I'd rather hang here beside you
Drunk on a liqueur of fennel seeds
The roaring shoreline's aside
Lined up into a whimsical cradle
We're rolling reckless and playful
I'll leash my fears beside me
Over the crowd I notice your smile
Following highways by hours that chide
At dusk we're driving down to the beach
Soft spot I'm wading through all these words
Let's build our castles and lakes of sand
On the road the burst out of silly jokes
Mumbled in my ear, your love is true
Bursting all apple blossoms are swaying
Say what - trying to make this work
And you reach over for my hand
Night brushed these mountains in purple
Crumbling fears that nestled inside
You know I'm smothered by all these words
A touch you touch I still comprehend
Humble nourishing my dreams of you
