Your energy is speaking
Uh, I've got a feeling
The truth is (tru-u-uth)
This is what kids do
Your body and your mind
You and me
Tonight, 'cause it feels like we're just kids
Wants to see your soul undressed
The angel on the other
I'm feeling
Wanna get inside your love
Singing, singing
I've got a feeling, feeling, feeling
I've got my hands all over you
So what if?
You and me, babe
The devil on my shoulder
And I wanna let you know
Wind me up and watch me go
'Cause it's you and me
The truth is (uh uh)
It's telling me to go ahead
Oh oh, yeah
We're just kids
Wanna get inside your world
Singing, singing, singing
Doing what we do so what if?
I wanna get, wanna get, wanna get
