I was trying to escape into outerspace on a bottle rocket
Yeah, I jumped and I flew till I fell where I am
Rain down, all over you
Oh but time, ain't got time to be waiting around
Baby its true
You should have seen my face standing at the gates
Following my feet
Good times are gonna come now, look 'round
Sunshine is gonna come now
Woah, my my
Woah, it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you
Baby its true, oh
Watching it unfolding, yeah oh
Swinging on trapeze
Tried to get away, but I slipped on my hands
I'm still cutting all my teeth on a faded dream
Put it in my pocket, oh
Sunshine
Rain now, all over you
Woah it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you
Sun is gonna shine, gonna shine on through
Throwing wishes at the street
Looking for a moment
I was blowing with the breeze
Baby it's true
Looking for a happy place, little piece of grace
Going through the motions, yeah
No one to unlock it, oh yeah
Good times are gonna come now, all around
She too busy paying money and she ain't slowing down
