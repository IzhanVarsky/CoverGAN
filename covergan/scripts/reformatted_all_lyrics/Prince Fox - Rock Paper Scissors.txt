I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off
You wouldn't be sweet if I dipped you in sugar (In sugar)
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors
I cut you off
But you bringing trouble when you leave the home
No, I'm done with you
But I want you to
Crying to me you're always alone
You know it's best, so why, why are you bitter? (Bitter)
You could be Aretha but got no respect
I cut you off, I cut you off
Just want a chance? No thank you, next
See, that's what you do
Rock, paper, scissors
Say it to my face, don't take my name in vain
Say it to my face, you know you can't replace me
