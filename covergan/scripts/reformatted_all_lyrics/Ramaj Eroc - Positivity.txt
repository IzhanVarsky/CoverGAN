No, we don't need new friеnds
I see the light when I'm with you
If you ever seek validation
But ain't nothing set in stone
I see the light whenever you post
Your indecisiveness is owed
But still feel darkness from my phone
Please do that for me
Please by positive
Though you get so upset
This is what humans do for love
With good hopes you hear them
Yeah, I know it makes you tear up
I sound upset, I know
Better than my friendS
But the trolls that bestow bad comments
There's too much negativity on my timeline
Yeah, it's always been two of us
Look, you get so flattered over likes
This algorithm knows me well
And still not get the response
Yeah, yeah
Argue then makeup
Yeah, aye
Merry go go round in circles
Back and fourth we go insulting each other for what?
In your camera roll
I be like "woah, whoa"
In the best direction
Damn, that's so antisocial
Voicin' bad opinions
But feel much darkness from this phone
Under one condition
Under photos shatter you
We been through it all
This damn explore page got me scroll, scroll, scroll
Can't have no one come scrеw this up
I wanna follow everybody that follow me
I know lust is temptin'
Girl, you know how social media goes
Who do you love?
Yeah, they matter to you
Please be positive
Please post positivity
But sometimes I may seem so vocal
Before you decided to upload
I done lost my senses
Just look in the mirror
For me
I'm so introvert
Girl, I can tell
They hurtin' too
But all you post is positivity in attempt to steer them
Girl, ain't nothing set in stone
Because
I know it took a good sixty pics
