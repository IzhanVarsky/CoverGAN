But I just get so damn insecure about it
But oh, my baby
Somehow the golden state has got me feeling blue
In the blink of an eye
Running around talkin about how I got nothing to prove
(Ohhhh)
I need a break from California lately
I don't wanna spend another minute waiting
(Ohhh)
Things come and go
I gotta go now, I gotta get away
I gotta go, I gotta get away
So far gone, with nowhere to go
And you got me saying
We can fly
Well, it seems to me my life is passing by
But running always makes me feel alone
Oh baby, mile high
But standing here just makes me feel this way
Waiting around for someone else to make my move
My soul is craving for a little change
I want you to go with me
I bought us round trip flights to Paris, baby
Cause I wanna go somewhere and only be with you
