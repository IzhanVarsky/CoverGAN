Be strong and solid to weather
That we were here
I wanna feel the sun
And when we're just a stone
I wanna reach for you
I wanna be with you
When the seasons change
And the leaves fall down
To come back around
I wanna bend with you
I want the world to know
And you can shelter me the same
Yeah when the wind is cold
I wanna show you that I'll be here
From a front porch swing
Wash the storms of life
And when the wind is cold
We'll wait for spring
I wanna stand with you
And our roots run deep
We should plant a tree
Whatever comes
Where the river starts
We should carve a heart
While our dreams grow wild
I wanna shelter you
We should make some shade
Watch the storms of life
In a hundred years
I wanna drink the rain
