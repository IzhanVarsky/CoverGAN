Don't leave me in
Lately I've been stuck like gum
Under the desk of classroom I once slept in
Spinnin' yeses and noes
And it's never enough
Why the silly face
Up to the ceilin'
'Cause no one sees them
I can't make sense
It's just the way it is for now
Pieces don't seem to fit
Just the way it is
Chewed all of its flavor and love
When the room's so serious
No one's happy
Don't remember where I parked
Of what you don't even know
The bubble never blew up
Feel like I'm losin' my head
The middle of your web
I can't shake 'em off
Caught up in the
I think I'm goin' too far
The basket was just too far
Spiders up the wall
