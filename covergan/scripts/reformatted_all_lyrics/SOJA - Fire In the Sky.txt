Slip, sliding away and you know it's never enough
And the world spins round cause everything changes
Every second you're in it, every minute your guessing
We make the hero forever and make each other the law
Slip sliding with purpose into the black into
That we weren't all connected in the essence
Cause the celebration into this life that you're slipping
Its just us
Of a final plan much bigger than us
Our earth is the blessing
And I never felt it before in the way that I feel it now
We are the fire in the sky
Like a memory that you just can't touch
And the resting place of the human race
Is the sky and stars and the poetry is just us
The sky and stars and feeling a suggestion
Like the universe is a circle and its basic
So until we meet again I am forever your friend
We are the poetry in motion
We just move on a minute
If the sky is the limit
We take the chance that we're given
We take the day at it's worth, we speak the truth that we listen
We go first on a second
In every city we live in
Cause in the air that we breathe in create the life that we love
You're begging for more and so on your knees you get up
We make the dream unreal, we make the rebel to god
