That you’ve never been
That this is all
And I feel it go
You go to places
Someone you never
When it’s easier to fall?
That when you dream
Every day
Walk away
Cause I can’t see
Is what we got
Still not happy
Answer this question
And I feel it blow
Why do we rise up
And it’s there to stay
Why are we here?
I seen them pray
Tell me the reason
That what we see
Even when you
It’s in your bloodstream
When it’s easy to stall?
Cause it’s still right there
But I feel a breeze
And I know there’s something
When you walk away
At all
Why do we move
You cannot ignore it
What I never saw
You recognize
And I feel it come
That I just don’t know
Loving each other
I heard them say
It’s in your soul
To their pockets, and they’re
Why do we care?
Met in Your life...
