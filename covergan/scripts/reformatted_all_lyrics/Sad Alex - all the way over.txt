He don't believe that
Is it all the way over
Yeah doesn't that mean that it's over
And I hate that I feel that
'cause
This could be something new
But I don't want to admit that
I don't even believe that when
I kinda wanna fall for you all the way over
You're in my head, he's in my bed
Yeah, I don't want to admit that
Yeah, I still can't commit 'cause
But now he's asking what this is (asking what this is)
'cause he kisses me right too
Doesn't that mean that, mean that, mean that it's over
I guess that's how it should, it's been over a year since you and me
Doesn't that mean that it's over
That it's all the way over
I try to say that I could never go back to what we were
Sometimes it feels like you, oh
It's kinda getting good with him
I want to tell him what he wants
Sometimes it feels like you
And any other girl would be able to answer easily
