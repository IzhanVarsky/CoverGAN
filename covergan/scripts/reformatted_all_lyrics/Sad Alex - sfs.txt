I don't got shit to say
In my mind
So fucking sad I know
(Kiss me)
Excuses for all my actions
Kiss me
I'll try to be good tomorrow
But for tonight I'm being me
With a love addiction, so
I got a glass half empty in my mind
(Know what makes me)
I hear them asking "what's wrong?"
So fuckin' sad
You can't get through to me
When I don't wanna smile?
Cause I'm a cynical, clinical, cyclical bitch
It follows me in the room
Find a bad boy distraction
I know you're scared of me, but
I feel a cloud full of doom
All the time
Let's numb the pain together, babe
I've been this way for so long
Can you stay for a while?
I'm so fucking sad all the time
Crying into a bottle
Why do you ask me to smile
With a love addiction I cannot quit
I got a glass half empty
