Oh, Why do I interrupt
Gonna call when I make it home
Try'na figure out if you mean the things you do
Only for you
Make you feel you're not enough
Only for you, you
If I make you feel like I want more
(Pitch shift sample: "Do-Beating")
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Try'na to teach you things you already knew
(Only for you)
It was a question, not an accusation
Oh, hell no
When it comes to you
And advice is something I can live without
No more, no less, than chemicals and pheromones
And I know you can't even think right now
And I was running like I do
When it comes to love
A play on words just to change your face
When it comes to us
A second guess, all the things, they're right around my head
And you should hold your breath from behind your texts
Oh, When it comes to you
My heart's beating upon my sleeve
That's not the way I feel at all
So bored when I'm on my own because of you
