And oh my god
Here's the place where we will love
And happily we'll die
I'm happy to accommodate you
Give me everything you have
I could fall in love with you
Bring what you can hold
Love, I know you must be tired
And here is where we'll cry
You and me
Here's the place where we will rest
In this house, in this house
For the ones we leave behind
I can make a space
Tell me what I have to do, to fall in love with you
In this house
After years of summertime
Oh my god
Tell me what I have to do
But I can see
Travelling this empty road alone
A place for us to make ourselves a home
To travel all this way
All I have is yours to give
You never have to leave
