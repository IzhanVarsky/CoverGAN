If I could do it I would undo that I had to lose you
I think it got me thinking just like you
You and I
Suddenly the party's where I knew you'd be
Every time
I told you many times I'm not like you
Still you managed to bring out the best of me
To realise I want you
Talk all night
Just like you
But you said you felt I'm in love with you too
Why is it so hard to stay away?
You broke my heart when I broke yours into two
I couldn't stop thinking we saw differently
Became so much more important to me
On the couch
