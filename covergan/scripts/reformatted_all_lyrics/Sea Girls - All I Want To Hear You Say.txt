There’s a part of me you’ll take away forever
It ain't easy to forget you
Oh, heaven on earth is a hell of a place
Even if I want to
I see you in the papers, I go to all your plays
It’s all I want to hear you say
That really
With a face made for TV
And I just want to know
Sometimes I dream about you running away
And that would do
You were caught in the headlights of your dream
Your body shape was a warning sign
And say
I’m on your news feed twice a day
No one can judge me for trying to get back
But that was a while ago
Better than I was before
Now we live in different worlds
I’d like to say hello and
'Cause I’m still working shifts
If you’re in Manchester will you come to my show?
If you’re in town tonight
Well, I want you to know that I am doing
And our delicate youth is starting to get old
How you doing?
You bring your hair and makeup to my flat
I want to hear you say
I can't look away
And even if I want to, I can't look away
Well, I want you to know
So, how you doing?
I knew it was only just a matter of time
While you’re putting on pearls
