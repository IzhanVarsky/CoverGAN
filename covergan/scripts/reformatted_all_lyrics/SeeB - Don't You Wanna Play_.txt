It's my little secret
Would it matter if I said?
So why you stepping 'round the truth?
I keep going over
And I can't get enough
You know we have a good thing
Of every little thing you do
Let's call it love
Play a little longer
If I only told ya
I'm wearing your t-shirt
Call it whatever you want
What are we doing?
I'm tired of pretending like
Let's not overthink it
Every moment in my head
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?
Play a little
And not just every other night
Not just friends with benefits
You're feeling me, I'm feeling you
And I don't wanna take it off
Together we're bulletproof
I want you 'round me all the time
We going nowhere
Let's just say it like it is
