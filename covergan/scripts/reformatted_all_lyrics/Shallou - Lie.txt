Fight then we break up
It's driving me too insane now, oh
And every little word you say
And then you spit me ou-ou-out
And no matter what I do
Like I don't know what's happening
You got my heart on all these different chains
Too stuck in the air
Keep saying I'm your everything
Act like it's only me and you
It's like you chew me up
Caught me in a hurricane
Keep saying we're the perfect two
Act like you would do anything
A hurricane
I can't try to change you
We're too busy living seperate lives
What's happening, oh-oh-oh
Kiss then we make up
The way you keep playing me, no fair, oh
Just wanna mess me u-u-up
'Cause every little thing you do
Like I don't even have a clue
When we keep going nowhere
Guess you don't care that much
But you don't got guts to look me in the face
What's happening
Tearing my heart in two, oh-oh-oh
Lie, lie, lie to me
Keep tearing my heart in two
You lie, lie, lie to me
