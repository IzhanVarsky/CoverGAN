Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
Coming for ya (Coming for you)
There's just some things that never change
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya (So damn hard to leave ya)
All along, I've been coming for ya (For you)
For ya
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la (La, la, la)
You say we're just friends
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya (Coming for you)
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
For ya (Oh, she loves it when I call)
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Ooh, I should be runnin'
And I hope it meant something to you (Oh)
Sapphire moonlight
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
Land in Miami
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
Don't ya let me fall, oh
Sweat drippin' off me
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
It's true, la-la-la (True la-la)
We danced for hours in the sand
Locked in the hotel
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
The air was hot from summer rain
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
