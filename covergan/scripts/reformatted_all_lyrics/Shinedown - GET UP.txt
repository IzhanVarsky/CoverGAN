Sometimes you're wrong... sometimes you're right
I know you're clingin' to the light of day
Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
I'm on the bright side of bein' hell bent
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Everybody wants to sing their song
Yeah, I don't know why I never talk about it
Stop stallin', I'm callin' out
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long?
Get up, get up
Ain't nothin' normal when it comes to you and me
But you gotta try, and I'm callin' out
And I agree you can do much better, trust me
So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"
I'm just gonna keep movin'
If you were ever in doubt
Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong
Who can't see straight (Can't see straight)
Guess you might say I'm a little intense
I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams
Today, tomorrow, and the next
And medication don't do much
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
Just gotta keep movin'
Yeah
To tell you everything's A-okay
But you gotta try, so I'm callin' out
I guess that's probably part of the problem
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long
Yeah, it just numbs the brain
And I agree you can do much better, trust me (Trust me)
So, take it from me, you're not the only one
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
