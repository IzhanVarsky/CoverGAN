You don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds
You’re not alone, I promise
I watch the news on TV
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
I want to leave you better
Have I the courage to change?
Standing together we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
Pouring on me
I am afraid to let you see the real me
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
You’re not alone in all this
We don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
World, I want to leave you better
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
The rain, it falls, rain, it falls
I am afraid I have no purpose here
World, you're not alone in all this
Abandon myself daily
Rain, it falls, rain, it falls
I want my life to matter
