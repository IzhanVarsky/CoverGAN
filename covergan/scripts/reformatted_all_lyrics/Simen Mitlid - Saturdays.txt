You, called me to say things are different but I'm still the same
Won't be long now
I'll take anything that will force me to make up my mind
Try to break it all down
I'm, too restless still waiting for something to change us with fate
Pretend I'm nowhere around
Everything keeps on floating
Save it for the morning
While, you're going back to the habits you had before mine
Everyone keeps on coasting
