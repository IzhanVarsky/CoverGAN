Dream me, stream me, glued to the TV
Up and elevate your life
I'm sorry, sorry to kill the vibe
They're always insincere
Build me, kill me, right click to fill me
My mind is out of sight
And will the hounds come and sniff me out? (Hey!)
And always insincere
I started something I couldn't stop
But my head ain't feeling right
Will we ever get outta here?
But without the keys, stuck at the door
And we'll never get outta here
And I'll never get outta here
The words are never clear
And it haunts me day and night
It seems that I've been here before
(Will we ever get outta here?)
And will the hounds come and sniff me out?
