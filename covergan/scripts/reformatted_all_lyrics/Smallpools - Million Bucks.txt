Got all my money on you
Some people say there's nothing really real here
We'll keep going strong
So I thought I could love nothing but the breeze here
The richest love ain't growing on the trees out here
State I'm in right now
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
But confidently, I can say I'm sold
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks
And though my dollars are few
They paint it like a sun without a soul
Makes me feel so right
I feel like a million bucks
But I fell hard for what just blew in off the coast
Salt drips from her brow
Stay all-in right now
Reaching for a star
No more days without
I used to be a skeptic non-believer
I can do no wrong
The ceiling's just the start
A bullseye from a dart
But now it's changed, you're worth your weight in gold
I've got all my money on you
