Primitive
Aaaaaarggghhh!
Let it bleed!
Who feels it, knows it
The god will guide me
You don't mean shit to me
How it used to be
We're back to set it free
Fuck all you wannabe's
Fuck all your politics
The way we want to be
Confronting the negative
Um, Dois, TrÃªs, Quatro
Fuck all your bullshit
We got our life to live
Forever we will be
Check your reality
Fuck all your wannabes
Primitivo
Back to the primitive
What we want to be
