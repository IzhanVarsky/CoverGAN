You was at the mall with your friends
But then you came closer
See you been all around the globe
I can be your melody
That girl is a dime they say
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That we would ever be more than friends
That girl is the gun to my holster
(That I can't keep out, got me singin' like)
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Who would have ever knew
Not once did you leave my mind
Remember the first time we met
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, yeah
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Doing things I never do
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Girl, you really changed my life
She like a song played again and again
Na, na, na, na, everyday
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me (ayy)
I was scared to approach ya
A guy that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
Someday, I wanna make you my wife
I'm in the kitchen cooking what she like
