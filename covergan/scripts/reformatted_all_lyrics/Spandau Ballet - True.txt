Always slipping from my hands
Huh huh uh-huh hi
Head over heels when toe to toe
(Huh huh uh-huh hi)
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
Oh, I want the truth to be known
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
This is the sound
Sand's a time of its own
Oh, I want the truth to be said
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
But now I've come back again
I bought a ticket to the world
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
I know this much is true
So true, funny how it seems
This is the sound of my soul
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Know this much is true
I know, I know, I know this much is true
This much is true
