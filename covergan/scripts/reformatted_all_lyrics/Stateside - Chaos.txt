(It's just us tonight)
Where we don't get to escape for a little while
We'll burn the city just
(Love me wild)
Burn the city just
Can you find me now?
Burn the city just you and I
(It's just us)
I need you to love me wild
We'll start a firе
If chaos is what you like
It's just us
Let me fall apart
(If chaos is what you like)
It's just us tonight
Hiding from the life
We'll burn the city
To find me in the dark
We'll burn the city just you and I
Sink into these sheets
I'll do just what you like baby
We'll start a fire
I like feeling you beneath me
Drowning in the moonlight
Rolling in the deep while we're still
(I need you now)
(Burn the city down)
We'll burn thе city just you and I
I need you
(Burn them down)
