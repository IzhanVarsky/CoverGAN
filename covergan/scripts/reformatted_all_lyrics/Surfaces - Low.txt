Yeah, I been feelin' low
I can't fake what I'm dreaming of
Do you ever feel that way?
Oh, this world is way too much for me
Lord, I know I pray on broken knees
Why won't you listen when I say it's all that's left of me?
My mama's recipes, my only remedies
This feel fits me like a broken glove
Try to run but keep on stumbling
Findin' love in a head full of melodies
Oh this world is way too cold for me
Can't you hear me from up above?
Will I ever be okay?
Try to talk but keep on mumbling
I'm findin' peace in a pocket full of memories
Seems like hell's freezing over, love
Ohh
And this coat won't fix this over freeze
