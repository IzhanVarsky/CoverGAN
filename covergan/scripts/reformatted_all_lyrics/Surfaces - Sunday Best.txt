And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
Everyone falls down sometimes
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Good, feeling good
It's okay, it's okay
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
