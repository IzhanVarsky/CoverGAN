Come closer to the knife
You see I suffocate myself at night, drowning in my dreamin'
Rhythm healer is your false defeater
I guess I laid my ego to rest
You don't even know me
Ah, ah, yeah
And there's a natural mystik in the air
Why don't you tie the noose
There's a natural mystik in the air
Oh I learn about your sacrifice
Said are you real and do you feel, and are you really there?
I'm seeking the truth within
Lock me inside of your cage
And turn the lights down slowly
No, I forgot my peace when I knew it was there
Hoodoo guru now I ask for your direction, please
And darling, you were looking at me with that innocent stare
Put your hands up in the air where I can see them
I kissed the ground, no I was never found
Voodoo truth
Lonesome wandering soul walked the earth, my heart was bare
Run circles through the senses wave
My heart was filled with sin
