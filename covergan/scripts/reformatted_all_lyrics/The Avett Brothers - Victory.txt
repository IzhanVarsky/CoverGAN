In silence, my darkness is denied
Do I throw my hands and quit?
Stories of courage clouded up with fear
Waxy green and yellow walls
Something tells me no
From Victory, I tried
I don't see the bright side, quite as clear
From victory I accept defeat
Am I sad or am I sick?
Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me
They don't ever last
I don't write 'cause I don't think
Of course, I was forced to retreat
Worries on all sides of my mind
Outside my windows fall
To match eternal light with how I lead my life
I don't have a need to speak
In the broom grass I would l lie
Accolades and happy days
Covering the light I thought I'd see
From victory, I tried
What's at the root of it?
