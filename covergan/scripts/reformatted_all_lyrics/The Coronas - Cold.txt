I never told you enough what that means
Even our friends are more than amazed
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold
We never got to say goodbye
I didn't think, I just talked I couldn't turn it off
Though it seems I'm still streets ahead
It came as some surprise
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold...
I can't pretend that I planned it out
No the night won't allow
Just witnessed the words falling right out of my mouth
Or give me a reason to see you anyway
It wasn't a fake, it wasn't a lie
And the night won't allow
How do we know?
A cold chill on my shoulder
You look at me the way I want to be seen
Gimme a reason to feel ok
Just a bit unkind
I'm too proud and the night won't allow
Gimme a reason to see you anyway
Think of me when you feel ok
It's not too loud
I'm cold but I will not show it
I'm too proud
They don't know what to say
Do we trust ourselves that much?
When I go I won't like you less
A cold, it's not too loud
