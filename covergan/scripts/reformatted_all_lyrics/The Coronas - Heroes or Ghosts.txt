Heroes or ghosts
But this is what we've got and there's nowhere
Or am I just too cynical for my own good
And you know these roads, they could take us to the start
And you could say we don't care or that we don't believe
There's nowhere we'd rather be
And there's nowhere we'd rather be
Am I too scared to say, we'll get there if we should
So here we go
It's harder than it looks, it's harder than it looks
We'll get there if we should
And you know, you know
From the shadows you've cast to play the part
One man's mood can break another man's soul
But it's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
So don't grow old, forgetting who you are
But I, I know, it's gonna take a lot of time and a little bit of luck
I've seen a reaction, now we've so much to prove
That it's harder than it looks, it's harder than it looks
And you know, oh yeah, you know
I've seen a reaction, yeah I've watched us improve
A simple goal could get you very far
But this is what we've got and there's nowhere we'd rather be
But this is what we've got
It's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
