Hoping you don't notice it when I'm
Get lost in the thick of it, sometimes
I hate to say that I'm wrong
Just a bit low-spirited, and I
Get lost in the thick of it sometimes
'Cause we're only growing, not unfolding (Sometime)
Just a bit low-spirited, I gotta face it alone
We couldn't even fake it one time
We used to be addicted one time
Walk until our feet hurt sometime
Do do do duh
Feels better playing along
Turn it into something that you never wanna lose
I'll say I'm guilty if it brings me back to you
Do do do duh do doo
Do do do do doo
I want a lawyer, give me a good lawyer too
I'm good for a little bit, but I
Won't make it better I could never do it all
Just a little knees-up sometime
I tried to salvage, left it alone
Hoping you don't notice it (Just a bit low spirited)
Maybe we could meet up sometime
I guess that's when we drifted you're right
And I hope you know it's never over
There must be nothing you've left to prove
Get lost in the thick of it
I've gotta face it alone
The way you walked away, it really messed me up
I didn't need it, I said enough
I'm good for a little bit (Just a bit low spirited)
Just a bit low-spirited, and I, I gotta face it alone
