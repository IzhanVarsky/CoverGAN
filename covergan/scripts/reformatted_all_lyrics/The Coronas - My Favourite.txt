What's that? I'm not making sense
Twice now I said I've had enough
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
As I watched you somehow self-destruct
Why didn't you tell us your mind?
And I'm not able
(Don't try to change it)
Did you even know?
I forced things to their detriment
As I watched you somehow sеlf-destruct
But the world made me afraid of
I force things even to their end
Music's too loud I can barely hear you
Well I guess I'm jealous a lot
How could you not know?
You're my favourite
Get your attention, you already know
Now at least we found a good excuse to love
I suppose we got to take it
'Cause I warned myself that these things might come up
Remind me again why we keep coming here
You're still my favourite
To love
I think we've been through enough
I guess I'm jealous a lot
Say your goodbyes, tell 'em you're tired oh
You'rе still my favourite
What's that? You're not making sense
