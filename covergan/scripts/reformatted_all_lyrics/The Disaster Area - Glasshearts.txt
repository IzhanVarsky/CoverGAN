I couldn’t see that I was lost
I’m talking to ghosts but I’m still speaking too fast
We know the truth but you’re in denial
And I spent to long finding where I belong
I’m talking to ghosts and they don’t know what they have
Did you get what you needed?
Hard not to walk away and put it all to rest
Gave you an inch and you took a mile
Hard not to walk away and put it all to bed
You took everything we believed in
Wouldn’t you like to know if they’re talking to me back?
The light to lead us through this misery
Go back on what you say and be a hypocrite
Wouldn’t you like to know if I’ll be taking it back?
We are the glasshearts
We are the misled generation
When no one ever seems to care or seems to give a shit
When it’s dark it’s easier to see
