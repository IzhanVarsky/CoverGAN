'Cause now we're apart
'Cause I, 'cause I love you so
Tell me why, baby, you're so
When I come off too strong
Any day or night
You can hit me on my line
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
Now we're apart
Oh, no
Oh, let me know
If there's something wrong
Have I ever turned you on?
'Cause I love you so
Oh
And girl, if it feels right
Oh, baby, you're so
Well, let me know
I look kinda crazy
Back when it was only you and me
Any time
Did I play or did I tease?
Have I set your mind at ease?
Oh, please don't get me wrong
Have I ever made you smile?
Ooh-ooh!
And I need to know
Have I ever done you wrong?
Oh, for even just a while
