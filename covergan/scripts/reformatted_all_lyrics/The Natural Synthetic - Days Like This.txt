I knew there would be days like this
To take the cuffs off of my wrist
Never let it catch me
But I don't wanna believe it
Now you saying we shouldn't talk
Days like, days like this
Sleep deprived, and I've been running
Just wanna know what you're thinking
I knew it but I took the risk
And maybe I won't dream of you
When i don't have a reason
Oh I knew there would be days like this
On the edge of the precipice
There would be days like, days like this
And now we're stuck in the grieving
There would be days like, days like
Maybe we're better off
There was a storm that we couldn't stop
I've been watching, the sunrise and fighting
Take the cuffs off of my wrist
I know it's late and I shouldn't call
