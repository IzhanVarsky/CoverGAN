Stretched out in the centerfold that I can't get out of my head
One shot and I'm holdin', but I don't care 'cuz I'm golden
So watch me here as I levitate
(We'll take you past the stars)
Seein' things right before me
We don't discriminate
(We're going past the stars)
But that's the old me
(Let's take this way too far)
So watch me as I levitate
And "give it up" was the best thing that they said
We're gonna celebrate
All these thing that they told me, used to mold me
Under the moonlight, another moment
'Til then, better go an' tell 'em
Used to own me, but that's the old me
Gonna celebrate
We almost had it all
Woke up Sunday morning with a song stuck in my head
(No matter who you are)
Once again, all bets say, they won't make it
Some day we'll have this thing figured out
o'clock in the mornin'
Better go an' tell 'em
We're going straight to the stars 'cuz that's who we are
