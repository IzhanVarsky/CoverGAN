I was just a lost soul, I needed a guide
I'm a different person, yeah
And the moment that you came to change my life
Turn my world around!
You have twisted all of my troubles inside
I know I was walking around in disguise
Oooooh yeah
(I'm-I'm-I'm)
All fading away by a minute and I
(Oh yeah, yeah)
(Looking back together, yeah)
Feel alive
It's a fact
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh, you fired up my heart and made me smile
Coz' you and I know that
Like a little piece of heaven finally found
Turn my world around
And you and I know baby!
(Turn my world around)
Fears I had
Turn my world around, world around
You've refilled my heart up from the ground
Looking back
Coz' you and I know, baby
