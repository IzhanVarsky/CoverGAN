Stare down your masters
We're on the verge
Say, I done told you
Shadows hold the mist
Tangеnts vex the whorl
Where you've wrought
Did the crowd, kind
Fractured as this wish
Say, dire warning
One and what you are
Of sacred dawning and sloe-sloe eyes
(Where you've wrought, where you've wrought)
Turning glass upside down
And those weak, as sand
The void arrivеs then leaves
With the promise of (With the promise of)
Shattered I resign
'Midst the chaff, as meek
Aping youth, wise
For the hours should they pass
Fragments form the mind
(We're on the verge)
Say how I tried too
(What you are, what you are, we're on the verge)
Did the times, wind
We're on the verge, we're on the verge
From creation's crown
Ever lost, ides
For lovers built the dream
Returning, returning a kiss
With the promise of (With the promise of )
