I got a secret but the way it makes me feel...
Feel...
You’ve ever felt in your life?
I play the victim, get defensive just rememberin' it
I got a secret, come and take a look inside it with me
And would you tell it now?
Would you tell it... now?
How is this make you feeling?
I got a secret and I gotta fucking tell somebody
It’s like the secret's seeping through my defense coming to me
I got a secret, gotta tell someone, come share it with me
What if it makes you feel more alone than
I'm burning up about it, come and step inside it with me
Your heart can't take it?
The more I think about it, I can't even vouch for me
Your heart can’t take it?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
Would you tell it now?
Now...
I’m burning up about the way it makes me feel...
I got a secret, gotta do something, come share it with me
You've ever felt in your life?
I never heard it, so I thought my mind was playing again
I can't keep it all locked up inside of me
