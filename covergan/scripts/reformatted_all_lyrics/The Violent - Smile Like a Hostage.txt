Speaking too loud could cast you to the wolves
So smile like a hostage
Behind the glass in the shadows
Be careful of thе ones who are unsure
We love to watch you
The sting is more intense
Fail your own game
Thanks so much
You patronize yourself
I'd like to take this time to thank you all
So we'll just smile and say
To the bee than the cattle
With your loyal believers
And smile like a hostage
Only thinking of yourself
And your words never matter
We hate to watch you
Now we're throwing stones
Dependent on your skills
So are you sticking out?
You're too much
Staking your claim
As to better suit you
Enemies and alliеs made
Trying to suit you
I've done so much and think of only you
See you through the key
You'd better make amends
