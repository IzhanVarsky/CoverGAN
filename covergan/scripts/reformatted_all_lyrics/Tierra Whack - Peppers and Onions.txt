I get lost sometimes, Italy, I roam (Yeah)
White folks yellin', "Yo, that's a brave nigga!"
I'm only human, yeah
To be real, man, I thought about pullin' the plug (Uh)
The pros and the cons of bein' the bomb
But often times I gotta remind myself
Peppers and the onions
Baby, you can have the tick, it might not be your time (Yeah)
We just wanna be free (Damn)
Shit crazy out here, have you high on drugs? (Damn)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)
Make a phone call home to the ones I love (Love)
A whole lot richer and a whole lot quicker
So I can go fly high with the ones above (Ooh)
You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn)
I'm new to this game, I ain't been here long (Long)
Yeah (Damn)
I had to figure certain things out on my own (Woo)
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn, damn)
Paparazzi takin' pictures like I'm in a cage, nigga (Woo)
So forgive me if I get this wrong (Yeah)
To combine my thoughts and never deny my health (Uh)
But I had to slow it down, 'cause I ain't no grave digger (Ching, ching, ching, ching)
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)
Even though we buy chains, we just wanna be free (Damn, damn, damn)
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
