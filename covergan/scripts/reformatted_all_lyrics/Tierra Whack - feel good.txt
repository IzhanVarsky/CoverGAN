But I can't forget that I'm still hood
Holidays just keep gettin' old
(Where did she go?)
I got everybody lookin' at me like, "Why she don't feel good?"
I done seen the stars, I done seen the lights
But somehow I can't seem to find happy Whack
Even in the summer, my heart cold
Whack, why you always be so bold?
All I really want is to be happy and truly feel good
Who can I look up to when I'm feelin' down?
Why would I lie and say I feel good, when I don't feel good?
Fake smiles never had me sold
(Holidays just keep gettin' old)
Just me and not you, don't want you around
It goes happy this, it goes happy that
