Smoking all my problems, thinking they'd disappear
Just breathe, just be
Focused on tomorrow, but today's still here
Maybe we will be happy where we are
And will we ever see without comparing scars?
Happy where we are
But they keep burning, all these questions in my head
I can't find a reason, but I still want more
Will we ever be happy where we are?
Am I too selfish? Am I too wrapped up in my head?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Everything I dreamed of is knocking at my door
'Cause nothing is working, oh, nothing
