Hey newcomer
Silver spoon
For soil
Of foil
So inviting
With a taste
You cannot school me
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake scene
Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
Ah, there goes the pulse queen
Talk cheap
Touch machine
Take a picture in your red g
Such a waste
Hey pretender
Talk big
See the stains in your gold teeth
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake
Hey fool
Don't forget another selfie
No tone
You cannot fool me
With no money
Walk bold
