I'm down if you're down, there's no way around it
When I'm down
My head blows up when I'm alone
Inside out, I might explode
I shut my eyes and my mouth and my legs just gave out
I get lost in and out when you walk in and out
Turn my hair in a knot, I get stomped in the ground
Why in the world would you hit me when I'm down?
