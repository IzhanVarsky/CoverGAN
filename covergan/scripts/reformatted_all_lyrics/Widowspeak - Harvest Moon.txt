I want to see you dance again
We could dream this night away
Just like children sleeping
Hear what I have to say
We know where the music's playing
But there's a full moon rising
Because I'm still in love with you
See it shining in your eye
Come a little bit closer
Let's go dancing in the light
And the moon is climbing high
On this harvest moon
Let's go out and feel the night
I watched you from afar
I want to celebrate
When we were lovers
When we were strangers
But now it's getting late
I loved you with all my heart
