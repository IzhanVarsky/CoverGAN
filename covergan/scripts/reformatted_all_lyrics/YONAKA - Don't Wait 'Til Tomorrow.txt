When you're drowning, I'm gonna dive in
I will always pick up my phone
Oh-oh
To call me up and come my way
I'm just caught up in it
Just know I'll be there, remember that I care
It doesn't matter where you are up in this world
Whenever you need me just reach out and call my name
I would love to see your face
It could never be too late
I will help you through this mess
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
I'll be right here for you
I'm gonna help you climb that mountain
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't wait 'til tomorrow)
If you're lonely you can call me, don't you know?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We could take it back to when
I'm sick and tired of you thinking it's unfair
When you put yourself there
I will always pick up the phone
I'm trying hard to get through
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It's all love, Heaven's above
If you need me at all
I'm screaming down your walls
Can you hear me at all?
'Cause I'm crying out your pain
Though it seems that I don't really care
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
Oh-oh, oh
I'll be there to fix you
We were young and were best friends
I'll be at your side when you've had enough
I'll be there when you fall
But if God gave me this much
I know that I'm not perfect
