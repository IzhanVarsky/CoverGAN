Out the window you can hear the people laugh
Before your soul hits the ground
Don't waste your life waiting 'round
Set the table, place flowers 'round the room
You can offer them a cocktail, but what's the sense in turning back?
Light the candles and don't pour the drinks too soon
Know yourself
Throw yourself a dinner party
You spend your life waiting 'round
Throw yourself
Treat yourself
