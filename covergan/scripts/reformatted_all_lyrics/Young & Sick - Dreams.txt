Dreams of loneliness
But listen carefully to the sound
Like a heartbeat drives you made in the stillness of remembering what you had
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
Now here I go again I see the crystal visions
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and
And what you lost
Have you any dream you'd like to sell?
Well, who am I to keep you down?
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Of your loneliness
Thunder only happens when it rains
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
And what you had
Say, women, they will come and they will go
I keep my visions to myself
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
