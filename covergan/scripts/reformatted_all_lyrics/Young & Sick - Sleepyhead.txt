Sleepyhead, ooo
And out your eyes, begonia skies
Everything is going to the beat
And you said it was like fire around the brim
They crowd your bedroom like some thought wearing thin
(Everything is going to the beat
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
Everything is going to the beat)
My beard grew to the floor and out the door
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
Burning solid, burning thin, the burning rim
I drag you back
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
Like the stars burning holes right through the dark
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
