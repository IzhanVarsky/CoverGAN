I almost missed the bus
Cause I'm always thinking of ya
That's just how you
Live like dynasty
Drop your love on me
That's just how you're 'sposed to
I trip when I kiss your lips
Make sure that you roll one up
You go and roll one up
So we can lay back and smoke up
I go hop on the bus
You feel all that I give
So we can meet up at your spot
I trip when I take a step
All your love on me
Cause that's just how you're 'sposed to
That brings me right up to your spot
I'll chill with ya if you want to
Cause you taste just like mimosas
