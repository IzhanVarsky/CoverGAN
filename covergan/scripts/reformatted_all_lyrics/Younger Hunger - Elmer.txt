Guess our secret's hard to keep when
What was it even for?
Just an explanation
So when you say you're sick of me and leavin'
I never wanna be apart
Everything I stand for is out the door
I just wanna make you mine
I'll save my breath
I wanna stick to you like Elmer's glue
That I am someone worthy of trush
But only if you leave his punk ass in the dirt
You owe it to us both
Why you gotta go in the middle of vacation?
I should've known from the start
You're worse than meth
Every single lie I told her about us
Like I hide you from my girlfriend you
We both got a lotta getting even to do
I told you that I'd leave her
You wanna be with me for the time being
Part of me's deceasin' to you
Girl I gave you my love
But it wasn't enough
Only wanna break my heart
But that's just a waste of time
I told you that I love you
You made me lose my way
I'm staring to believe them
You and I are barely even work friends
(Oooh) Why you hide me from your girl friends?
