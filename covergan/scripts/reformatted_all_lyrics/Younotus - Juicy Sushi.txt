Ah, alright (Yeah)
Make me go drown
You're on a diet
'Cause you like wasabi
You don't like it fried
J-J-J-Juicy sushi
That's fine
My tongue roll like ginger
Just let me be your sides (Alright)
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Baby, you're down
You and me in my (Jacuzzi)
You and me in my jacuzzi
Juicy sushi inside out
Ah, alright (I don't–)
Just, just like sashimi
I–I'm no beginner
But what about the sides?
I'm crying at the party
Inside out, you're salmon trout
Oops, got no bikini
That's fine (That's fine)
Juicy sushi
