You can't stare at the sun
And when the tide's too hard to bear
Try to stay afloat
Oh, down the drain, wash it away
Nothing grows overnight
Try to stay afloat (Try to stay afloat)
Searching for blue butterflies
Find an ivory tower
While you're swimming in pools (While you're swimming in pools)
Hold your virtues now
And I swear you'll see it bloom
Our waterways don't always flow the same
I swear you'll see it bloom
The same
And don't you drown, I'm counting on
Treading undersize
Seeing you get wiser
While you're swimming in pools
You wish you didn't notice (Didn't notice)
Gets dark
But there's still light from the moon
Let it strip you of the things
Can you take things slowly?
Cover yourself in the wind, it's closing in
Just like storm water
And hope it never fades, it still gets dark
(Never the same, never the same)
Spiral in your atmosphere
This is a reminder
It may take some time
Searching for blue butterflies (Searching for blue butterflies)
We're just swimming in pools
Hold your virtues now (Hold your virtues now)
