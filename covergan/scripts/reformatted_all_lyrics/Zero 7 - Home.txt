Too late to wonder how
To finish first
Sing in the key of night
Lost in cheap delirium
Make me somewhere I can call a home
Beautifully broken down
Too late to learn from experience
Searching the neon lights
Take me somewhere we can be alone
'Cause lately Iâ€™ve been losing on my own
Cause lately I've been losing on my own
Sink in the city aquarium
Wrapped in silent elegance
As they're watching me
Won't you take me home?
I move carefully
As illusions burst
