All you do is pave the way so I could reinvent myself
You can watch me glow
Even though I tried so hard to forget it
You're all that I could see
When I could hardly walk on my own
You'd never wait for me, even when I ran away
Let you go, let you go now
You love me right for a minute
I could wait a thousand days
I had to lift myself out of the trench below
Haven't I suffered enough to let you go?
