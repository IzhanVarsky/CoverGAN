Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Got me sipping on that dirty cup
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh no, and now I'm just your prey
Girl you got me drunk and I can't help it
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup
Dirty or not yeah you got it
Yeah yeah yeah
Must've been that drink that you gave to me
It could've been for nothing
(Whoops)
It might be worth the wait
Like maybe you're that one thing
But honestly it could've been the right thing
You got me right where you want me
Wanna keep drinking you up
Don't need the one thing
And now I can't tell left from right yeah yeah
Don't wanna keep on trying
What was in it?
You got me thinking it's not right yeah yeah
You got me feeling
I can't tell you lies even if I tried
Running through my mind damn you so refined
