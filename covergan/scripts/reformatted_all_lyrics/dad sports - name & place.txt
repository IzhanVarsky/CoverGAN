He said it's all inside your head
Calm down and fall back 'til you're dead
In a day or two
Will I still be around for you
It's almost like this isn't real
Why do I never feel?
Christie is running through your door
But I still see you so
In a year or two?
Wonder how she's been here before
And you still see me too
But I'll still leave without a sound
