Until forever disappears
There's no mistletoe above our heads
On Christmas day
Two queens in a king-sized bed
Yeah, I'll kiss you anyway
I don't have a lot to give
With my skin
Like angels in the snow
But I would give you everything
All my time is yours to spend
And then I want them all
Your freckled cheeks, our tangled feet
So let's stay right here
The closer, the better it gets
Let me wrap you in with my skin
But I'll kiss you anyway
Two queens in a king-sized bed (Hmm)
My only wish is one more year
