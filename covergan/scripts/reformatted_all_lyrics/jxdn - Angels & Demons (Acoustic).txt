I'm fallin' from Eden
Tell my friends I'm sorry though
One gunshot could solve 'em
No one in the world can stop me now
I'm falling from Eden
I'm so sick of the nonsense
I don't really think I'm the problem
Up, down, all night, yeah
Oh oh
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
I'ma dive into the mosh pit
Tell my sins to go
Don't forget my name
No one in the world can help me out
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
And all these angels and demons
I don't feel the same
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Took another line, I'm calling
Black, white, left, right, yeah
Two face, two face, yeah
On a trip, no train
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I don't really think it's a problem
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Everybody said that I'm falling
Oh oh oh
Me plus me is a problem
Can't escape it ever
Oh oh oh oh oh
