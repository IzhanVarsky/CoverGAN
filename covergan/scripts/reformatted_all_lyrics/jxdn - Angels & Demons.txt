I'm fallin' from Eden
One gunshot could solve 'em
(Fuck me like a rock star)
I'm falling from Eden
I don't really think I'm the problem
Fucked up like a rock star, riding in a cop car
Up, down, all night, yeah
(Rock star)
Took another line, I'm calling, uh
Tell my friends I'm sorry, though
T-t-t-tell my sins to go
Don't forget my name
No one in the world can help me out
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
And all these angels and demons
I don't feel the same
So fuck me like a rock star, dancing on a cop car
Black, white, left, right, yeah
Two face, two face, yeah
On a trip, no train
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I don't really think it's a problem
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Everybody said that I'm falling, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit, uh
Me plus me is a problem
(Rock star, rock star)
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
Can't escape it ever
