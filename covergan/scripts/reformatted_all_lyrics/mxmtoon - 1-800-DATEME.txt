Never really figured it out with someone
I never really figured it out with someone
I'm quick to gush
Sorry, sorry, back to the song
I prefer Netflix over everyone (I'm so Tumblr! Hashtag relatable.)
My own valentine
I can't deny
But it's better this way
Please date me!
Guy after guy
Mmmmmm, mmmm, mm mm
Oh guy after guy
Crush after crush
But it never works out so I'm done
And I'm lonely and single
It's Valentine's Day
I'll be my own valentine
Oh my God wow I'm so lonely
I don't like to mingle
Wow lucky to be
Even though I cry, I'm not in a rush
I'll be my own valentine, it's fine
