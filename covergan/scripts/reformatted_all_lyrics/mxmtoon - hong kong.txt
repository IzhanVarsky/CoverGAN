Your family is moving without you
But you can't help and drop your jaw
Your family is living without you
My memories, they feel so vivid
Red brick and bamboo towers
A home away from home
Hong Kong is moving without you
Big family with too much food
With neon lights that attract your eyes
And dim sum was always fun
Been years since I've been back
Maybe one day you'll see them again
You're missing a piece of yourself
Line the skyline with much power
Yellow cars and smoggy skies
Hong Kong is moving around you
Yet, oh, so far away
Yet so much time has passed
You left it behind you there
It feels like I'm losing track of time
And my memories will slowly fade away
My memories will slowly fade away
All the way across the sea
Late nights were alright
You can't help but stand there in awe
Maybe one day you'll see
That your family is living without you
Don't it feel so unfair
I don't know when I'll be back
No matter how much you plea
Oh, just eat more and don't be rude
