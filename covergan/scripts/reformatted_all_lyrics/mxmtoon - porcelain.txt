Over and over again
Stretches and patches corrupt my flesh
But I really can't seem to ignore
With marks and lines, it makes me feel weary
Because they say what's inside is what really matters
They line my body and caress my face
I am made of porcelain
My inner demons, they always win
Slowly eating away any confidence that's left
Cracking now and then, it wears me down
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
My skin is a story
Oooooo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo
Oh, over and over again
I'm cracking now and then, it wears me down
So many things that I've come to hate
But even with the good
Like a china tea cup with dried out glue
I feel so frail and empty too
My face is like a galaxy
And in my mind they saunter
With spotty freckle stars and no sense of gravity
The parts of me that I abhor
I look okay but I am breaking down
It makes me feel like I am weak and battered
And I am made of porcelain
My appearance dictate how much I fret
The bad feels so much stronger
And I really wish I wouldn't let
Oo-oo-oooo
