Something more, something more
I'm better off alone (Yeah)
You know I really don't mind being alone
Until you came around asking for help
That I need something more
It's been a couple days since I've left home
I really don't mind being alone
But I'm better off alone
I've gotten used to dinner with my phone
And you can try all you want to convince me
I was feeling good all by myself
I'm better off alone
And when I do I keep my headphones on
Something more something more
