(And everybody knows that)
And I know you want to
Now watch you move
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
And lemme show you how
Just step into my shoes
Now I don’t know what you came here to do
You only move a muscle when you sip on your Bacardi
To come to you
And if you don’t know really you should get a clue
The music’s getting louder and I feel like this is a party
(show you how)
But it’s all up to you
Get up and get loose
I can make you groove
If you’re feeling kinda nervous well then baby you’re invited
You’ll never be too cool to dance
Like I wouldn’t understand, but I do
I see you standing in the corner looking for somebody
If you want to you can take my hand
Just come a bit closer now
