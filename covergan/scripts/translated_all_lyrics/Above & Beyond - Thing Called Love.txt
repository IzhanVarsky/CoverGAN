So here we are, all just the same
My fear entwined with my regret
A parachute of pride
Don’t forget, forget about a thing called love
And you will never know
Cause there’s a thing called love that we all forget
And it’s a wasted love that we all regret
But there was fear inside
You live your life just once, so don’t forget about a thing called love
My secret plan, how close we came
A witty line to save my face
To tell you how I feel inside
I’ll beat a path for safe return
Is it just me? I’d like to know
To cross the line takes a tiny step
Or are we all just a little blind?
And I haven’t lost my only chance
To share another road
But will a spark cause the bridge to burn?
There was a time, there was a place
