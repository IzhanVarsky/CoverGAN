Yes, with the two of us
Then I want you to know
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Hey, look at us twice
Should never be different
Hey, you do me like that
And if I lose my head, you stand behind me
Did you ever think we'd get this far?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Hey, you're doing me so good, yeah
Look over at me and immediately the feeling is there
When you face me, I know it'll stay that way
If I don't show it
'Cause I don't want you to ever forget
The best thing here is you, yeah
And I want you never to forget
And it gets complicated
From your little "Hey"
What I felt never goes away
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Even when we're discussing
And my shy "How are you?"
Now I just want you to know
I want you to never forget that I have your back too
