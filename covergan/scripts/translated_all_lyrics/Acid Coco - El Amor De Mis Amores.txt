I didn't want to wait for you
I can't love you anymore
But for me it doesn't matter
And I can't love you
And I don't want to have you
My heart more and more like a stone than a sponge
I don't want to have you anymore
And when I think of your love I have nothing left
You always forget that I exist
And I can't have it
Now I leave you on seen
The love of my loves is you
Dead in life I feel
I lost the romantic way of seeing life
Not one more lap by your side I will give not one more attempt this is going to deserve
We are happy from the inside, I know that, but what can I do if, deep down, I love you?
with your smell of yesterday
And the little face of me was not
I think I'm going to go crazy
I see you pass with your backpack
Every afternoon I wait for you standing on the corner
