sitting in the sand
And she smiles at me
And she comes and goes from the sea
let me show you
Cumbia is the queen
that there is no harassing
I invite her to dance
This cumbia when dancing
And to the rhythm of the cumbia
And when you let me go you'll see
What if I dance alone
without even looking
if you want to enjoy
Then she turns and tells me
A cute brunette wiggles as she walks by
