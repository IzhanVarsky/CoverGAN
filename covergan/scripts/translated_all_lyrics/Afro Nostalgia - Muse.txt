Don't even doubt it (don't even)
If you 'bout it
You know I won't refuse
I just caught the blues
I know that you like it
You glow like the flowers do
Don't question my honesty
I picture me and you
So baby fight it (baby don't fight it)
Monochromatics (monochromatics)
Your body is aquatic
Just Like the cameras do
You know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm gonna follow you
Shawty is my muse
So don't get it confused
She brought somethin' new
Whatever she asks
Looking at her move
We don't need camera crew
Your vibe is exotic
Lovin' the s
I'm 'bout it
Born in the s
Till the end of time
You know that I fell for you
She came to my world
You cure my neurotics (cure my neurotics)
No need of a parachute
I'm gonna follow
The way that I bite it
