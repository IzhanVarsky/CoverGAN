And I failed to see the forest for the trees
For a moment I was making my way to the base
Well, isn't it just my luck
And that's the reason why I’m outta clichés
The more of me I give them, the less they give a fuck
Ooh, I've had enough
And if there's anyone that I should avoid
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
I finally found us a mess to get into
But isn't it just my luck
Little bobber in the water
For the bait they put in front of my face
So if there's anyone that I should avoid
The easier the answer, the more it tears me up
With a chip on my shoulder and egg on my face
You probably asked if I was really ever anything but ready
The easier the surface, the more it cuts me up
I'm gonna try
