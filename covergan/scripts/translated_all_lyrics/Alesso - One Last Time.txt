You already have a part of me, part of me
But I feel you coming back to me, back to me
Won't let, won't let, won't let, won't let
It's you and me against the tide, I need it one last time
Just sink underwater, I know it's not over
Pull me, pull me, closer, closer
Out of love, out of touch
Fill the space with your embrace
