Had forgotten
Being single is today
I can't get used to your speech
Yours is typical, illogical
No thank you very much
And today that you come back to look for me it's clear to me
Throw yourself to the ground to see who picks you up
Because with you everything everything is complicated
I don't even look back to gain momentum
I live calm as I am right now
right now no no no
why we thunder
I appreciate but not
The story is over there is no episode two
I'm surprised what you asked
What did you like?
The bad life and all the time make me dramas
Dramatic very complicated oh oh ohâ€¦
Your case is clinical, so critical
I do not argue is not cunning
I'm not in the mood for love
I have no desire
leave my heart calm
I did not remember
It's worn out and that's none of my business
Speaking clearly I'm no longer interested
Not right now
