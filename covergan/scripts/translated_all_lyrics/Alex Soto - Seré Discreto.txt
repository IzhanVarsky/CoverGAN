I promise you
With me your secret is safe
It is evident that it depends on you
If the bite goes on the lip or you prefer it as an earring
I bring you
Where I put the eye I put the bullet
A necklace of kisses and a deal let me put it on you dancing
I bring you in my sights and this time you don't escape
As a sniper, I like to chase you for flirty
I will be discreet
If the bite goes on the lip
I want to go down until very late, when no one sees us
And I can't stand it, I want you to stay only in shoes
and you can keep it
I can't take it anymore, seal the deal with a kiss
I bring you desire for a long time
I will not make any statements about it
It simply depends on you
I want to catch you on a full moon and mistake me for your bike
Or do you prefer it as an earring
And see you walk, climb behind you up the stairs
you know how much i want you
It's you who defeats me, you love to provoke
