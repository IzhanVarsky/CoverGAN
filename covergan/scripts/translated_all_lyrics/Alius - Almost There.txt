I was turning red
I have better days
Now I don't overthink it
You used to know me as a shy one
Closer to the edge
Oh
Oh-oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
I've never wanted to be famous
I only do it for me
Like all my problems I don't have one
Learned from my mistakes
Like I was meant to be creative
I use my words as therapy
Now I found a way
I'm on the run, nearly done
Oh, I'm getting there, I know I'm almost there
Um, I'm the one, nearly done
I'm all grown up about it
'Cause I held my breath
I'm really close, I've nearly won
