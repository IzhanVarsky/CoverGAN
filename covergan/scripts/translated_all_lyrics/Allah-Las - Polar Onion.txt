A room full of stares
Caught on a stand
Far too close
Left for the vultures
Does it scare?
Cut pole to pole
Layered like an onion
Stuck on a stand
A casual observer
Stuck in a cycle
Drowning the sea
(Oooooooh)
A subtle unnerver
Spotting the scene
The tide is high
A tired assertion
Acidic environs
Sicken the host
The end is nigh
Out in the cold
Foreign to most
Waters will rise
I fill my cup
Out of its lair
Is it old?
But it's not enough
With no one aware
A sordid affair
The record repeating
