Don't wanna leave alone
Losin' all self control
What are we waitin' for?
Had no plans to show up (Ah-ah-ah)
Was about to leave (Ah-ah-ah)
Hold on me tight and don't let go
And focusin' on me, yeah
I can feel it, feel it coming
Oh, I like we're dancin' slow and
Dancin' until they close
What are we waiting for?
How we get this close?
Hold me and don't let go
Turnin' nothing into somethin'
Oh, I like we're dancin' slow and (I like it)
Little loud as madness (Ah-ah-ah)
Losin' all self control (Ah)
The possibility
Wonder how far we go
Keep my mind at ease (Ah-ah-ah)
You came out of nowhere (Ah-ah-ah)
Keepin' me distracted (Ah-ah-ah)
I don't know how we got this close
I do, baby do you? Woah
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
I'm losing all my self-control
