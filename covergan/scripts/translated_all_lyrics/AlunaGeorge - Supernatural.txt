Oh, your touch is haunting me
When you hold me
Resuscitated too many times
I go interplanetary
So close to real we can't tell its fake
It's so extraordinary
Is this dead or is it alive?
Is this dream state or awake?
When you're simply holding me
Creative science that we make
Supernatural
All hands up for the big finale
The perfect innovation
Supernatural, supernatural, supernatural
Must be a gift from a future crime
I circle it, too many sides
Make this up for the ceremony
