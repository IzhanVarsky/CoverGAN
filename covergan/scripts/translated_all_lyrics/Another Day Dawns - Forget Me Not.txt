When will this end?
Can’t kill me cause I’m in your head
I’m breaking down
Done with the secrets
Forget me, forget me not, forget me you can’t kill me
Erase me
I don’t need this
I’m torn to the core
End your hatred, I don’t play dead
Pull me apart again
Just an afterthought
I’m done
I’m failing
With your secrets
Why can’t you listen?
Forget me not
How could you want this?
All the sweetness beneath the scabs
Right down to the stem
You can’t kill me
My heart is on the floor
Burn me alive and do it again
Why do I try when it hurts so bad
