And I’m still thinking like, "How I get so lucky?"
Wanna write "I love you" in your tummy
Call you on your break time
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
Only thing I ever wanted was you
I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
How I get so lucky?
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
I need you in tub, baby, like a rubber ducky
It's no time that my mind go off and needing you every night like my iPhone charger, real
Call me on your break time
Even call your grandma like, "How I get so lucky?"
Even got the cake now
Yeah, yeah
I've been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Staring at your face like
People staring like it's summertime and I got scully
Hoping they become me
And the person that I am becoming is you, uh
Childbearing is your waistline
Staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
And the person that I am becoming is you
Death due us part, I'ma Tiller no Kentucky
She be lookin' like she from another country
Happy that I took the time to bag my baby like a cubby
But I still be thinking like, "How I get so lucky?"
No comparing to your face ma
Taking online class, I'ma eat it while you study
I been staring at your face, I been staring at your face like
I'm always asking God like, "How I get so lucky?"
Pray to God, "How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?"
How did I get so damn lucky with you?
With you I never got nothing to do
Stuck in a love and I'm lucky
Hit me on the FaceTime we get lovey-dovey
Ladybug in honey
Waiting for the days I be kissing on your tummy
No sleep thanking God like, how I get so lucky
Even call your ma like, "How I get so lucky?"
I'm like, "How I get so lucky?"
Yeah
Putting a little oney in your egg like the Easter Bunny
Staring at your waistline
Told me "A ladybug landed on you, honey"
Sweet that I only bear with you if it’s gummy
