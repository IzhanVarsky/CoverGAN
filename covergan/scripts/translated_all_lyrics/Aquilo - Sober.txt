And suddenly you're sober
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
Get your kicks from someone else
You've got a chance to say it all
And suddenly we're sober
Take your time and tell me what you're thinking
Just 'cause someone says it's over
(Is learning from me)
With their head upon your shoulder
Don't look at me
All the things I wanna show you
Glad you're not me
The hardest way to learn your lesson
What is it you're waiting for?
Cornered by your self-obsession
All the things I wanna show you (show you)
Tied your tongue and fucked it more
