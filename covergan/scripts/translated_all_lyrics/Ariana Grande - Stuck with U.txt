I could stay here for a lifetime
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I'd rather do
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
Ain't no other way that I can spend it
I'm not one to stick around
(What?)
(I'm stuck with you)
Mmm
I could stay here forever
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't trade
I lock the door (Lock the door) and throw out the key
Got all this time on our hands
Don't care if I sound crazy
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
I'ma get to know you better
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Go on, make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
There's nobody on these streets
(That's just for fun)
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
Got all this time in my hands
There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
Kinda hope we're here forever
Baby, come take all my time
Woah
Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
All this lovin' you, hatin' you, wantin' you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
Hey, yeah
You, oh, oh
If you told me that the world's endin'
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
Ah
Can't fight this no more (Can't fight this no more), it's just you and me
One strike and you're out, baby
