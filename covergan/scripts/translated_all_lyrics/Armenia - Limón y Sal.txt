I love you as you are
You get in a weird mood with every full moon a month
I love you with lemon and salt
But everything else beats the good you give me
You don't say anything romantic when the sunset comes
Just having you close I feel like I'm starting over
Then you disappear from me and I don't really understand why
Sure of what you feel
You don't need to change anything
Sometimes something looks like it, but it's pure chance
Then I come to meet with your eyes they give me something else
I have to confess to you now, I never believed in happiness
Just having you close, I feel like I'm starting over
I love you if you come or if you go
(Is it over already?)
I have to confess that sometimes I don't like the way you are
If you go up and down and you're not
