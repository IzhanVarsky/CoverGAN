Crawling inside like there's no one home
Lеt me drown
Active in the problems I so tried to avoid
A shadow moving closer
It creeps up on you, it drags you down
I told myself I wouldn't become this
It's not fiction anymore, it's so very real
I just can't seem to find the answer
All my darkest fears arе laid out one by one
Grabbing hold of what I want to believe
We run from our problems like there's no tomorrow
Our reckless minds are so tainted in sorrow
The raging flames around me
The black dog, it comes, it hunts, it follows you
A victim of my mind and it's only just begun
Breathe it in, I let it consume me
Pull me out, pull me out or let me drown
An outline of the person that I once was
Let me drown
A fire that's burning, it catches on my soul
I won't let it wear this hollow crown
The stranger in the mirror is smothering me
