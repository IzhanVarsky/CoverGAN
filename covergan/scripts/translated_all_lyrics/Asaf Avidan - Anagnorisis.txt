Drenched to the bone
Anagnorisis
Finally, I know
I swim to you
End
Sleeping away
Deep in the ocean
It always ends bad
Drowning my body
I call redemption
Finally, it's clear
It's always been you
Love is a wave
To where it begins
How long has it been
Follow it up
Rain starts to fall
What you call home
Peripeteia
Around our bodies
This time it won't
Dormant inside me
Inside our bodies
