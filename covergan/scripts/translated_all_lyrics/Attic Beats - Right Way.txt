I’m sure that I can arrange that
Don't worry, I'm not out of town
I'd hate to see you go
Tell me what you really want now
I’m there on a daily basis
Pick a night, any day
No matter what you do or say
I'm sure that I can arrange that
Looking for a piece of mind
Holding onto nothing good
Been running from your demons lately
I don't mind babe
Imma love you in the right way
Searching in the wrong places
So I'll make sure I'm the only one
Honey, we don't have to slow down
I don’t mind babe
I can love you in the right way
