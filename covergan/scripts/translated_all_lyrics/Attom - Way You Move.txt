Remember how we used to be
Am I in your head?
We were feeling, falling in deep
When it's just you, you in your room
Are you, are you empty now?
We were happy then
Do you still think, think about me?
Wanna know the way you move
Are you empty now?
Please dream of mine
Wanna know the way you think
When you close your eyes
What did you forget?
