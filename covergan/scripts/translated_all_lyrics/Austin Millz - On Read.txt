Done with the small talk
Payin' the fee 'cause my time ain't free
On read, the metaphor spill out
'Cause love don't live here anymore, so
I never listen
All that I hear is the same thing
You say it's my fault, I never listen
Played the cards wrong, now I'm yellin', "Uno"
I recouped it all, now it's time to leave
I don't feel no shame for that
Shawty's callin' every week, right, right
Never listen
A couple long nights, make you feel single
I'II just leave you on read
Haha
'Til you outta my head, right
The game I done been out, only call me when you need
Was just thinkin' the same thing
It's all the boy saw when the text message sent out
Knew I had you on a lease now it's time to pull my rent out
And no need to text back, baby
Head, head, head, right
You've done it again
Playin' the blame game
Just leave it on read
You say it's my fault
Water me with lies then the less I grow
A lil' more than wanna give each week
Selfish, I know
Never really tried to relate with you
Had to let go
'Cause everything's sweet, right
Head, head, head, head
Always booked, never free, right, right
A couple goodbyes better than a fake hello
The more you speak, seem the less I know
But it's hard to see when you act so whack
'Til you outta my head
All that hear is the same thing
'Ti you outta my head
You throw the same fit
I was just thinkin' the same thing
We been on this road here before (Before, before)
You got somethin' special
Guess I'II take some blame for that
I feel like we already know
I'II make my bed and lay in that
Checks comin' from the beats so my number is reserved
Fact or fiction, it's all pretend
Saw you at a penthouse, so had to pull my pen out
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
