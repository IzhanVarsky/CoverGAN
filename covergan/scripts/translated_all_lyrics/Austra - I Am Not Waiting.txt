You dedicated, I'm over you
Anything at all
We fear we're confessing
I am not waiting for you no more
(Will you help yourself now
When does the ripe fruit fall
Like love asks you to?)
Over, over, over, over
You've had a warning you just ignored
I'm over you, I'm over you
A sweetness I've been craving
You owe me a romance
I'm over you, I'm over you (Over, over)
I am a mountain grown out of work
Maybe you're just jealous?
Run away from the trees
Run away from the tress
Into our laps for taking?
Run away like you never believed in anything at all
Run away like you never believed in anything else
When do the seasons change?
I'm so tired of listening to you
With your hands above your head
