Oh, I'm all out of salt
I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry
I'm all out of salt
That's when you want all in, but I'm not your woman
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I learned it all from you, oh-oh
When my lipstick pops and I feel like Monroe
'Cause I look way too good tonight
Oh-oh, you're the snake pulling my arm
I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry (Oh)
Oh-oh, I've been breaking hearts too
Oh-oh, I got breaking news
I got my thigh-highs on, feel like Wonder Woman
And it's not about you, oh-oh
Like my snakeskin Saint Laurent, oh-oh
That's when you want me most, oh-oh
Not gonna cry, cry, cry
Won't give you what you want
I'm all out of salt, tears are running dry
Push my head into the cake, no more
Oh-oh, when I'm 'bout to celebrate
