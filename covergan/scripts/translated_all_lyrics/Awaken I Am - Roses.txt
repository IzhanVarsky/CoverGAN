Then you looked me in the eye
My head's a mess, when you’re in it
Now we're taking off your tights
It's am and I’m gripping on a cigarette
Now fill me in, were you into him or just upset?
And battle with my self-restraint
Who can hold a to and I'll never make the time
(Know when they're dead)
I forget, let's blame it on that glass of red
I tell myself to walk away
(Know when they’re dead)
I feel that we’re close to the end
Guess I fell asleep in my car again
Roses don't know when they're dead
And make my blood course through my veins
As usual, we fight
Is this fair?
'Cause roses don't know when they're dead
You shift your head and meet my gaze
Said I’ll never be the guy
We roll over and play pretend
I feel that we're close to the end
Guess we'll blame it on that glass of red
Roses don’t know when they're dead
With one foot hanging from the edge
