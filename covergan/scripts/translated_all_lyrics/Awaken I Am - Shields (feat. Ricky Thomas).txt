The future is letting you near
I’ve had my turn
Quiet I bide my time
These crowded spaces
I won’t compromise
It makes the mirror harder to see
Savoring silence
Avoiding blind shoulders
Within your reach
Like dogs around a bone
There’s yours and there’s mine
(In your mind) That we must now intertwine
Waiting for resolution
Somebody to leave me whole?
It’s something I should know
Take this indulgence
I stand on my own
This time
(In your eyes) By a subconscious line
Live with the burden
What must I lament for
Preparing their cages
Beneath the defeat
To drag me from my throne
A rhetoric sign to be left alone
(In my eyes) I feel I own this right
I won’t be disguised
Take your toll
All forgotten
I gave you my all
New and old faces
Our place has been divided
By a hand in tonight
These rules will always be guiding me
Waiting for you all
And I feel like I’m the only one
(In my mind) But I’m not feeling alright
I’ve taken chances deploring advances
Reveling in seclusion
From patient to anxious
Always be finding me
