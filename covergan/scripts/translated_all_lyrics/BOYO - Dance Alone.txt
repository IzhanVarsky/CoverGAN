I know I'm not the culprit but I'm on my fucking own
Amnesty and anguish on the phone
No more
I don't mind the judgment no
We could laugh in shoulders, in cold
Make me seem untangled and unknown
Comedian, keep me on my toes
Dressing up in all my father's clothes
Speaking of impermanence I know
I can speak your language if you want
I dance alone
Keep me at an angle don't forgo
I just mind the tone
Lets dance alone
