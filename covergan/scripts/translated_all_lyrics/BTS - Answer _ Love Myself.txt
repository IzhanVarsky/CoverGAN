I'm still looking for myself again
Because he is also a part of you, you
What I need the most
Still inside of me (Oh-oh)
Yes, that beauty (Uh-huh)
Uh, what's going on for me now (Ayy)
I'm clumsy
Whose permission did you need?
When the sound of your heart beating is unfamiliar
There is only one answer, ayy
Yesterday's me, today's me, tomorrow's me
Answer me with all my breath and the path I've walked
I should love myself (Oh-oh-oh)
act right for me
those thousands of splendid
Yesterday's me, today's me, tomorrow's me (Woah)
Did I fall for (Hey-ey-ey)
Now let's forgive ourselves
There is a heart to know (Alright)
(SUGA) Maybe more than loving someone
caused by my mistake
Let's be honest, let's admit it
The road to my love (No way)
Into your mask (Hey-ey-ey)
The arrow's target is me, ayy
I'll show you what I got
I wake up in the dark
Even the scars are my constellations, ayy
You've shown me I have reasons
Our life is long, trust me in the maze
Somehow, this is not the answer (Alright)
to the end of the end
There might not be an answer (Yeah, yeah)
The more difficult thing is to love yourself
But I don't want to die anymore
(I'm learning how to love myself)
more beautiful beauty
from the beginning of the beginning
After winter, spring will come again
Answer me with all my breath and the path I've walked (Oh-woah-oh)
cold night gaze
thick rings in your life
Sad me, sick me
attitude for me that's happiness for me
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
To hide my shabby me
Why do you keep trying to hide it?
Frightened eyes, old questions
even just loving me
I tossed and turned a lot, ayy
I should love myself (I'm learning how to love myself)
I see you in the mirror
to meet those countless stars
(Oh-oh-oh)
I'm not afraid because that's my existence (Love myself)
Without exception, without leaving behind, everyone is me
