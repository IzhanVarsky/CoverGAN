Only the sound of a slow heart in my ears bump, bump, bump
Scream silently
I keep losing focus
Even if you want to escape, jump into that mouth, jump, jump
Killin' me now, killin' me now
Deeper
nothing can swallow me
I scream with all my might
Tell me now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
i saw me
I can't reach any song
in the deepest
Do your thang
Yeah, I think I'm goin' deeper
I'd rather go on my feet
Inside I saw myself, myself
Film it now, film it now
strong waves
Let me go now, I hate it
This is my studio, my studio
I can't hear any sound yeah, yeah, yeah
tell me now
But what if that moment's right now, right now?
If you can't make my heart tremble more
I been always afraid of
Only the sound of a fast heart in my ears bump, bump, bump
If this makes me cry no more
Every moment becomes eternity yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you hear me? Yeah
Time seems to have stopped
Oh, that would be my first death
Even if I struggle, the floor is everywhere nah, nah
Do your thang with me now
Tryna pull up
i'll jump in
no more listening to music
I'll never be taken away again
Slowly I open my eyes
Grab my lost ankle again yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, say your heart ain't beating
What's my thang? tell me now
How could I ever die like this
Open your eyes and jump into my forest, jump, jump, jump
The sea where all the light is silent yeah, yeah, yeah
Even if you pass me by in the dark
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Slowly sinking as if possessed nah, nah, nah
What's my thang?
