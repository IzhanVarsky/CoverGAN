I hope all my weaknesses are hidden
What is love, it's all fake love
May love be perfect only with love
(Woo) I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I grew a flower that could not bloom
Talk to the mirror, who the hell are you
Now I don't know me, who are you?
Even if it hurts, I could pretend to be strong
Erase me and try to be your doll
Cuz its all fake love, fake love, fake love
I wanna be a good man just for you
(Woo) I just know, I just know, I just know why
Smile, tell me you love me
I used to know you well
I changed everything just for you
say no
I could pretend to be happy even when I was sad
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love
I forgot the route I came from
Love you so mad, love it's so mad
No, it's not what, I'm blind
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
In a dream that doesn't come true
Even you can't understand me
if it's for you
I make up pretty lies for you
Love you so bad
In our own forest, you didn't exist
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Look at me, I have abandoned even myself
Why you sad? I don't know
it's unfamiliar
I don't even know who I was
(Woo) I don't know either me or me
I gave you the world just for you
I changed into the me you liked
