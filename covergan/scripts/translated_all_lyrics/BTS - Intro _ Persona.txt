Every night I roll around disgustingly
never hesitated
I called it hesitation
if you could answer
Dear myself, you never lose your temperature
Yeah I may have been deceiving me
Yeah, my name is R
This is the measure of the direction I want to hang
Am I a dog or a pig?
You know it comes out when you're drunk, it's like drunkenness
With just a few words for a guy like me
I really like it, but it's a little uncomfortable
he wants to see the forest
Persona
I may have been open-minded, but I'm not ashamed
All the voices 'til I die
How come that's actually my everything
I don't know man
my name three characters
Oh, do you wanna go?
Others will come and wear pearl necklaces
I remember and people know me
God bless you with so many beauties
The me you love and the me I create
With regrets that I can't get tired of anymore
I made myself
The world really doesn't care
have you already forgotten
What kind of music is me?
I still don't know what
So I'm askin' once again, yeah
hey why did you start doing this
"Who am I?" A question I've been asked my whole life
Do you think you're alive?
Times that there is no turning back
Do you wanna fly?
my shadow
All the shoulders when you cry
Each time you made me stand up again
you just have someone to listen
Sometimes even hypocritical and vicious
first question
Some say run, some say stop
Smile more often than before
You keep staring at me oh shit
What is my calling
Even now, every minute, every minute, we live and breathe
this is my soul map
my flaws i know
She says look at the wild flowers
The smiling me, sometimes the crying me
Where's your soul?
How you feel? How are you feeling now?
Tell me all your names baby
Because it doesn't have to be hot or cold
Whether under the stage or under the lights
it was just good
The superhero I wished for
my clumsy
you didn't make it all
Even if I twist it like a habit
I just wanna go I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you
I want to be who I want people to be
The question you'll probably never find an answer to in your lifetime
It should come first but
Where's your dream?
I think it's real now
Who the hell am I?
Sometimes it just seems like bullshit
But more and more things are being said
Do you wanna die?
keep appearing
Ah shit
to vomit me
Cock tuk
But I know one thing
What kind of muse am I?
What kind of truth am I?
hot like a haze
After that
