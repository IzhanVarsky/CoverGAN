Good, the penalty is back
I wanted to tour you and you messed it up (You messed it up)
In a hostel with the desire to eat my last dance
I ended up having to pretend, when I lost you
Shit, I should have been alert
Where I go?
You turned it off, baby, you fucked it up
Descend on your hair (Ah-ah-ah)
Think wrong and right, my love
Knowing little, little by little the money
Hunger came together
Give me your hand, let's bite the sky
I descend in your hair
I'm done (I'm done), for having to pretend, when I lost you
We are two kids, doing cinnamon
It's over (It's over) I already feel like a joke (It's over)
It's over, I feel like a joke
If I have not yet made the threat of breaking the shell
And today karma avenges my mistake
I told you to come back but you didn't want to (-sists)
I wanted to be a breeze for you, laughter for you, everything for you
when gray reigns
By your waist painting missteps
I descend in your hair (I descend in your hair)
I know if I had you near
I always had you more in mind than my own goals
And where do I go? (oh)
Where I go?
I wanted to be (I wanted to be), breeze for you, laughter for you, everything for you
My mind and its gin would drink from temptation
brawling hormones
We are two babies, doing the canelo (Yeah)
It's over, I feel like a joke (It's over)
I say that I forget you and I compose another song for you
You turned it off, baby, you fucked it up (You fucked it up)
I have to apologize
blame me for the inconvenience
And where do I go?
