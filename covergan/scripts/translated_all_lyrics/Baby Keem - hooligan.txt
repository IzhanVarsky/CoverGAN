I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I start to question what freedom is
I am above the buffoons, stop it
'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
I am above all the rules
Like she's entitled to it
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
I need another exit at the show
(Huh, huh, huh)
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid (Huh, huh)
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
So what is the use of my dick?
I get the call and I go
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic' (Huh)
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
I stopped wearin' VVs
Look at my wrist, it say "Freeze, freeze"
Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
I get the top while I skeet off (Huh)
Eat the pussy so good
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
I'm done, bitch, go to your room
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
I learned that shit from the gunners
Even if I take a loss
Hooligans, they on the way
For the ones down, I say, "Free y'all"
Had to influence the wave
Hop in the ship, go to space
I give 'em ten and be done with it
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
But these are not regular clothes
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
Drive to the crib on the lakes
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
Y'all gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Mask on, they don't know who it is
