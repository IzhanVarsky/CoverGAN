Listen night and day
And simple harmonies
Let the music take control
Thank you sir
Out there
To all the bands that play
Great music
With its catchy melody
Everybody sing this song with me
The songs play the music
I knew what I would be
As the music plays the band
On the radio
DJ plays a song
Music
For the music
Wrote this song
Back in
Let the music take your soul
For all of you
