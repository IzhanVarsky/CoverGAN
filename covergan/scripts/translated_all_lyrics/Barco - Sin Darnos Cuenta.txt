I do not forget what I lived
while the world burns
Every once in a while that light goes out
It wasn't perfect but it was what we wanted
It's not over, the window is still open
With a burning heart and new marks on my skin
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I no longer believe in the border
May your morning light up
And without realizing it, the hurricane passed
And that you can be a little more at peace
that divides our wave
Made a whirlwind, our bed split
It wasn't perfect, it was just what we could
And without realizing all that happened
wherever you are, wherever
While the world burns, burns, burns
