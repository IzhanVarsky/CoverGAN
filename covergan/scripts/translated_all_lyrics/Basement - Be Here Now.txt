All the things you said
Why can't I just be here now?
Here now, here now
It's looking like I lost myself in the moment
I said it, I said it
I'm breaking from the inside out
To make it, to make it
No more surprises when
Here now, be here now
I sold a smile today
When I'm in my head
I'm trying too hard
I lost myself in the moment
Face to face or miles away
I hate it when I've lost myself in the moment
I'm in it, I'm in it
I end it, I end it
I'm selling lies again
