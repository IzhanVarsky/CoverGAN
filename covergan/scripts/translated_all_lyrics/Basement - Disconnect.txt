Can't see the other side
Can you help me out?
And I'm too scared to get up
Have I been away too long to stop this?
Lost all my sense of time
I've lost all my sense of time
Please do not forget this is what you wanted
(Lost all my)
Feel like I'm sinking, I
With time while there's something left
My prodigal son, what have you done?
Can I go back to where I started?
My prodigal son, what have you done
To make you feel this disconnect?
(Lost all my sense of time)
Onto this carousel that won't stop moving
Return while there's something left
Feel like I'm sinking and there's no way to get out
Promise me you'll find a way not to be disconnected
I can see the other side, I
I close my eyes as I keep going
