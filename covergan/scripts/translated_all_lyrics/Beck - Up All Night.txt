When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go
With you, with you
Up all night with you
Now get yourself together
Let them know that you're there
If you don't really care
If you got the time to take it up there
With you, you
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Just wanna stay up all night with you
Keep on moving
Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now
Hands up in the air
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
Wanna stay up all night with you
The sirens all singing
One, two, what you doing?
Right into the rhythm now
Living out on a prayer
I just wanna stay up all night
Don't wait for nothing now
I hear the noise ringing
Oh, keep on moving
Now I'm feeling so far away
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now
Looking for a diamond
Wanna get my body loose
Put it up in the air
I'm trying, I'm fighting
I been running out of bounds like an animal struggling
Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)
I been jumping through some hoops
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Night is crawling up to the day
