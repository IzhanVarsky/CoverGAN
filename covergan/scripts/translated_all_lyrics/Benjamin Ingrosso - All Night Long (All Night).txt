Everyone's dancing their troubles away
(All nigh-, all night)
Let the music take control
All night long (All night, all night) (Oh, no)
All night long (All night, all night) (Yeah, yeah)
Throw away the work to be done
All night long (All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Feel it in your heart
(All nigh-, all night, all nigh-, all night)
Lose yourself in wild romance
See the rhythm in their feet, yeah
(All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on and sing along
Come join our party and see how we play
Life is good, wild and sweet
We're going to party, karamu
All night long, all night long
Yeah, all night long (All night, all night)
Come on and sing along, yeah
All night long (All night, all night) (All night)
And feel it in your soul
Let the music play on
People dancing all in the street
Fiesta, forever
Well, my friends, the time has come
All night long (All night, all night)
Everybody sing, and everybody dance
All night long
To raise the roof and have some fun
