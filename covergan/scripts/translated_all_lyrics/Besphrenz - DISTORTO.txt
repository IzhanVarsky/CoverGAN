But this shit's a little overrated
When you say it I ignore it, I ignore it
Ain't even know me if it ain't business
Guess I got it twisted or something
Take another shot I know I shouldn't
Sayin' things when it ain't important (Woo-ooh-ooh)
Man they ain't listening
Shit, what did I get into, yeah?
Playin' a game like an addiction
Like ain't showing love if they ain't listed
Can you open up a window, yeah?
Day trippin'
Duh-huh duh-duh
Shit I'm looking for something that ain't listed
Brain insane anyway it's way different
Dooh-ooh doo-doo, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Packin' up and leavin' in the mornin'
Feelin' like a couple though
It's a, different night same story
Wake up in my jeans and in my hoodie
Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got lost with you
I think I'm so high
A listing
I don't wanna be the one to say it
