Adjust my dreams for me
The surface will break?
Releasing the pressure
This is the sound that we make
Is this how
I love the sound when it breaks
We’re shouting in the streets
Hell hath no fury like a human born
And we can't unlearn what we've learned
Dear God
Its only real if you can’t replace it
I’m sure we’ll awake
All I learned is instant history
I got a fever in my bones
We only exist in the noise that we bring
But the history’s a nightmare
Why do I fear it?
We could go
Can you hear it?
Gets me so high that I can taste it
The horrors that await
To any time or place
‘Cause all our love is instant history
And now I’m losing all control
We try to position our lives on a string
And we can't unhear what we've heard
