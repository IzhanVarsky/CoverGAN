We are the wolves!
You stink of hallelujah
There are no reruns
When you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
This is the point we have the choice to be happy together
Justify your reasons
How’s it gonna feel when you’re standing there alone?
We have achieved so much more
Take me and my worth
But you wash yourself in sin
Than you possibly thought we could
You are no exception
This is the point we have the choice to survive the winter
This indelible creature
When you gonna try to boil my last bone?
This is true obsession
Now it is my turn
More than just a scald
Subtle as a steam burn
Drive your every whim
Record this?!
This heavenly creature
Just remember, no "I" in team
Your fits of paranoia
We live in a kingdom of blood
There’s two in brilliant
Well have you seen her?
You can achieve anything
We are the wolves of winter
Love that you’re seething
How’s it gonna feel when there’s no one to support ya?
