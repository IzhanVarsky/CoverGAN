I don't wanna be in depression
I ain't got no time for stressin'
Everybody tryna push me down to the ground
On and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on, rollin' on
I'm telling me to, telling me to cheer up
And it's so cold like Siberia
But I ain't living life in the bottom
One step, so deft, so right, go left
If we could all just find a way to fly away
We should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
But I do not want negative energy
The love you give is the love you get
And when we talk, be nice to each other
I just wanna be cool, live my life without the problems
I got a new direction
And all of my banger that bang with they flag
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life
Be hood to each other in the house-a, mi casa su casa
I'm tryna turn my vibration around so I can feel fantastic
I'm talking to all of my leaders
Stay in your bag
Whether Crip or Blood, be good to each other
Hey, be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
I don't wanna carry no bad vibration
And fight for each other, not one another
If you get what you give, give me positivity (Give it to me, hey)
And do it to 'em right away
To slip into a brighter day (Say what?)
'Cause I do not want negative energy
So be nice and change your life
Be cordial, be glad, be happy, not sad
Be nice, be nice
I don't wanna feel nasty
Be nice (Hey)
Be nice
I just wanna be happy
Be different, be nice
Everyone around got tears of a clown
I'm talking to myself in the mirror
