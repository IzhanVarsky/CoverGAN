I know I'll never be the same
Have you seen the sun today?
Just wanna be okay
And I know that it's never easy to hear your name
I wanna be okay
I'm scared to go out today
Been pacing a line from the sink to the couch
Just wanna bе okay
I'm searching for sounds and for anything new
And I know I'll never be the same
And right now I'm needing to make a new change
I'm anchored in doubt
Just something you can't contain
And is the sky still blue?
And it's never easy to hear your name
See life through a windowpane
I wanna bе okay
