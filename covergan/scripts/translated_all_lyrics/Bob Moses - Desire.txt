Wasn't like they said it would be
You're not alone
Feeling like it's hopeless
It wasn't what you wanted
You're not alone, you're not alone
Now I'm being honest
I don't want your desire, I just wanna be free
I'm looking for release
And if you feel like letting go
Oh, nothing comes for free
I don't want your desire
Falling into focus
I was so eager to please
