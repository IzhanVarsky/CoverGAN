I guess you wonder where I've been
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
What you won't do, do for love
In my world, only you
I came back to let you know
And though I only want the best, it's true
You've tried everything, but you won't give up
Make me do for love what I would not do
I searched to find a love within
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I can't believe the things I do for you
But they may never find what they dream of
Some people go around the world for love
Got a thing for you and I can't let go
You've tried everything, but you don't give up
