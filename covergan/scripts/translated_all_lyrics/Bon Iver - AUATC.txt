I'll always know that all that proper mounts too much
It's only fair it burns up in that rust
Well, you're up all night
They ate up all their cake
(So shed a little light, oh Lord)
Help will surely come around
Well, you know the burden ain't a gust
I don't ask
Only them whose pauper lays him up
If you can see your own kite (Shed a little light, oh Lord)
Help is surely on its way
I don't bask in the glory
The only path to love is touch
They were always on the take (Will you shed a little light, oh Lord)
And it's not right
You know a burden ain't a bust
And they drank their own wine
Lay all that alabaster down
No no no
Well you're up all night
Lay down the holy banner flag
And your neighbors don't know
You are the only way to trust ya
Oh no (nah nah)
Hold out, Martha
Man, your neighbors don't know
And it's up to me if I don't wear a mask
But oh no, they can't come take that part away
Don't bask in the glory of mine
You know that truth's been known to crutch
And your head's down low
There's no master and
Lay down, Martha
