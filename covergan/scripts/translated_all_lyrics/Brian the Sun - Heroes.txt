Brian the Sun Lyrics for "Heroes"
The sky that spreads infinitely
I woke up with a dream of moving away no matter how many times I approached
Even if you scream over and over again
The dull me and the world that surrounds me
I'm a tiny person, but I'm still looking for an indelible light
Someday all of them will be flowers
Even if I draw or grab it, it's still far away
You can cry
I was tremendously scared
No matter how many times you stumble, you will be there
Whether fictitious or real
I'm shaking, I'm looking for the meaning of existence in the dark
I'm the only one
I'm sure I can go beyond
You can reach it no matter how far you are
laughing
Filled with signs of dawn
Look at the white sky and carve it here
You can fall
What to throw away to get there
The city is hiding its voice
I can run without a map
