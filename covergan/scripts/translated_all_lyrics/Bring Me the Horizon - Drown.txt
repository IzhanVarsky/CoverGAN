One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Who will fix me now?
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
('Cause you know that I can't do this on my)
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Hold my breath and let it bury me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
