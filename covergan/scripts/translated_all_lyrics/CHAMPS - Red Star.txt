I'm a red star lately
Through the red door faintly
Tattered throne and a broken crown
You thread the needle sky
Ride alone in the rain my love
Through the dark all night
You hold the wings of a wild-born dove
To see the only star
Touch the fear of fire
I hold the beams of rider's sun
To pass the night away
To make the old time pay
