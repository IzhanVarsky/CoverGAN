I'm buried in lost time
When your momma can't take the heat
I need a replay
Even the dawn is getting sick of the day
By the side of the road
You know I'm only towing the line
I did a lot to crucify your reputation
Now I feel I'm falling behind
I didn't have to justify my invitation
All of my money is for running away
I'm chasing a goldmine
(Just can't find your feelings)
Before I can repay
Brother, know where I'll be
Take me to heaven with the money I'm owed
I'm a shadow on the sea
I'm running on water
Are we river swimming? Saint Marie
Even the sun is getting sick of the day
You can be the starlight in my constellation
Not a meter of headway
Lately, it's a matter of time
When you just can't find your feet
I'm sat on the runway
Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie
Talk to me (just can't find your feelings)
I did a lot to justify my invitation
