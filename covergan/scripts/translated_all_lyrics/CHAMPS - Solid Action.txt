Are you at the station with your tombstone bell
x
A solid action
I’m falling through the floors again
All the roses and all your ideas
All your desolation and coloured tears
So you can shoot to the top on solid action
And it’s a short, sharp hit
On the cold ocean of sweat you had
All your intuition, your ill-placed fears
So call me buddy
And it’s killing my heart again
Do you feel let down?
All the dreams you made at high tide
All your papers are picking up dust again
And in the blink of a solid action
On the beach side, or in your hotel
Are you missing, or picking up dust again
I’m picking up stars again
Your five fingers are picking up dust again
But don’t call me friend
Then I can rush to the top of solid action
I’m fading through light again
All your demons and solid ideas
