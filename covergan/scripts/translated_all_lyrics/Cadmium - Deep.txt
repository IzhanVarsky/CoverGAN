Behind these eyes, secrets lie
But the mystery is awesome
(I want you to love me)
I, I want you to love me
You see too much
You feel my skin
Tell me your fears, theyâ€™ll stay right here
Can we begin?
You might never see the bottom
Tell me your fears, they'll stay right here
A single rose, a thorn will grow
Loving me is a little rough
On top of yours
Dive in
I want you to-
I want you to sa-
I want you to lo-
I want you to hurt me
You're in so deep
I want you to save me
Behind your walls, broken doors
Don't let me be forgotten
