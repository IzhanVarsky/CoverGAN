And everybody's watchin' her
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
I say, "Your place" when we leave
Yeah
We say nothin' more than we need (Than we need, than we need)
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Who knows why it's gotta be this way (Be this way, be this way)
Baby, this is what you came for
We go fast with the game we play (Game we play, game we play)
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
