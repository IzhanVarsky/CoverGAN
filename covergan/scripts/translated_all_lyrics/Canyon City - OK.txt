A few guitars, a couple lines
Hey, I’m not ok, but I’m better than I was
A white light opened my eyes
Hang, lingering and fade
Now they’re filled to the brim
I couldn’t close them anymore
There’s so many days but none they made you for
I can promise you there’s sunrises in store
Stay, long till it’s late and the colors we become
When you’d float through the door
Give it time, it comes back up
Here alone and I was fine
Say, it’s been some day, and we’re finally in the sun
Though the nights are long, there’s peace you’re walking towards and
Say, it’s been some day, laying out here when the sun
If you ever feel like nothing here is yours
It couldn’t be what I couldn’t have
I used to want a little more
Never enough and never sure
In some time it comes back up
I used to think I would die
And you’re finally in the sun
Hang, lingering and fade, in some time it comes back up
It's so bright now that you've come
Stays long, till it’s late and the colors we become
No moments ever coming back
But I don’t need those empty hands
Leaving nothing much behind
I used to think I would die here alone, oh what a lie
No matter what I had before
When your love slipped in
A broken heart, white lies
