I want to see you when I wake up
But it seems eternal to me...
I'm coming right now
I waited for you until the end of the day
Daisies grew in my hair
In your skin it never dawned
Right now I'm going, right now I'm going
And if you were a little slower
You're always telling me right now
I will change the rhythm for you
But you arrive when I'm already asleep
You ask me for a little more time
speed is relative
Uuh, uh-uh
you would come to stop the time
A moment for the universe
I'm going, I'm going now
I'm coming right now (I'm coming right now)
It must be that you are never in a hurry
I'm here right now
you love me but slowly
And I'm going, right now I'm going
