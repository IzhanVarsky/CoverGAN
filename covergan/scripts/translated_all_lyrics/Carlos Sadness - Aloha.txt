This is a message
And I bring you the color that you need
Anyone there?
you are already here
Hello
I blow you some clouds that cover you
Just in case, I want to tell you...
Pa' that you look in a cool way
(Me'!)
So that the world is softer
Stereo bomb in a cool way
They felt alone
Sun that shines in the morning
I don't feel alone now, o-o-ooh (Ouh-oh)
I bring you a ray of hope
And when the waves move
I don't know where I'm going but I'm going with you
For all
those who once
I bring you straight to the beach
From Barcelona to Santa Marta
That's why I say aloha, a-a-aah
If my gaze does not reach your eyes
I hug you, I dance for you and I take care of you
If you want I'll stay with you
I don't know where I'm going but with you I'll go
I know I'm not alone
I bring you straight to the beach
Although you think that right now it is not necessary
You want to come?
Aloha, a-a-aah
Can you hear me?
From the other side of the galaxy
So that it looks cool
That you are not alone, o-ooh (Ouh-oh)
