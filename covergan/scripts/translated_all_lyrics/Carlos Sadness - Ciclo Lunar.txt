You come to look for me, you come to look for me with your lunar cycle-ar (Let's go)
And they said that the stars
Which is very fire sign
To go with you in your astral travels
That you have already seen the future
And I stay to sleep in your giant eyelashes
I see you repeated in the same instant
You say you don't make it up
You come to look for me, you come to look for me with your lunar cycle-ar
And that is not what I expect
You say I don't fit in with you or your moon sign
With your lunar cycle
In case I put something wrong
And... now I spend the nights without being able to sleep
that you talk to the stars
You say I don't fit with you or your lunar cycle
To see if a message in the sky is for me (It's for me)
But baby you're always right
I didn't believe in that shit
They want to see us apart
You say I don't fit in with you or your moon sign (Your sign)
you wanted to read my hands
And if I look at you through a diamond
You say I daydream
To see if a message in heaven is for me
You only look for me if the moon is in the middle
You only look for me if the Moon is in the middle (If it is in the middle)
everything is so spatial
