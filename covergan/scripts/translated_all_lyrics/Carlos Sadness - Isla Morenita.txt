Lost on the brown island
Because there is an island in the middle of the sea
And the air is ours, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you want we can come
And my bones tremble?
Where the most tropical fruit grows
In a bit
What do you have when you stop
There is an island in the middle of the sea
Putting your ear on a shell you take me from Barcelona
where you are
Because there is an island in the middle of the sea where the most tropical fruit grows
In the flowers that grow in your hair (Oh, oh, oh)
Let's laugh at the bad weather
The one that tastes like... your kisses
In the flowers that grow in your hair (Yeah-yeah, woah)
And the air is ours (Let's go)
Why don't you take me to one of those places?
oh brunette
With palm trees and monkeys that know how to talk
where are you the center of gravity
until you touch your teeth
Brunette, take me right now (Oh, oh, take me)
Take me (why don't you take me?)
where you say that there is no time
And they tell you... secrets
Brunette, take me (why don't you take me?)
Sometimes I think of you so loud I think you can hear me over there
You can't imagine how good the dark suits you
I'm so small that I fit in a dream
Let's die of laughter
to give me a kiss
Lost on the brunette island (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, little brunette
Take me (Take-take me)
You're going to take a shower and I already miss you
