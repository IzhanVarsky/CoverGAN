when you wanted to see me
As if you never did (As if you never did)
I like it when you make me coffee
and stay to live
I like it when we go to the beach
The first word you dedicated to me
I stay dreaming, with you
Although it was very cold on the tips of your feet
When everything was alright-eh-eh-eh-en (When everything was alright)
We surf in bed at all hours
We see the sea together through the window
When everything was fine (So fine)
But I never see it (But I never see it)
Back to the first time I had you in front of me
I like it when we go to the beach (To the beach)
And we stayed up all night
How nice it would be to return
Although it was very cold on the tips of your feet (Yeah)
And how good it would be to meet again
Even if you only drink tea
Every day there is a sunrise
When everything was fine, when you wanted to see me
That never repeats, constantly changes (No)
Even if you only drink tea
and start to know each other
We measure the size of the waves
Whatever time it was, it was to not return
In the midst of the noise, among so many people
Where no one returns and we were fleeting (Yes, yes)
Like you never got around to it
I like it when you made me coffee (You made coffee)
Cause all your kisses are a different color
I miss making out with you all night
