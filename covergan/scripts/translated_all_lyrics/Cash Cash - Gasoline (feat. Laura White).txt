It's hard to breathe
Hit me with adrenaline
Why do I come when you call?
With, with gasoline
And when we get so close, it's hard to breathe
Don't open the windows
Oh, right
Oh, no
Wearing what your wearing
Turning up the heat again, oh, nah
Fire (yeah)
Fire with gasoline
Caught up in the tension
Fire
There's no end to you and me
You got my attention
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
Crash into me like a car
We don't even get along, oh, nah
Don't need innuendos
I know that we shouldn't start
And when we got so close, it's hard to breathe
Turning up the heat again
Hit me with adrenaline, yeah
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (Gasoline, gasoline)
Don't let any air in
With gasoline
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (It's hard to breathe)
Ain't no way to say no
Chemically our chemicals are dangerously beautiful
