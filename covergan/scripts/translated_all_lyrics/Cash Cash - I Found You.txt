Felt the wind underneath my wings
That it all would've been a waste
It all would've been a waste
On the way I was crowned a king
I found you, I found you
I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions
I've been the zero, the hero
To the city they were mine to keep
I found pessimism, I found skepticism
I found cynicism, I found criticism
Gone along for a wild ride
Over time every lock'll change
And I can say lookin' in your eyes
I've been high and I've been low
And I have been the villain
Played the fool and the star of the show
I lost more than a heart can take
But I found you on the way
But you love me all the same
On the way I was given the keys
I found you on the way
It all would have been a waste
