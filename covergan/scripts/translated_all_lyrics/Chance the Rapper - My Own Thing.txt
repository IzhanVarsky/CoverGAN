Take her to the culprit then I take her to the store (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
How you gon' raise yo' voice?
I was with a ' (Yup) sellin' s
My new girl a freak, she my type, she unique
I'ma do my own thing
She just like my personal space, got a circular waist
I don't like to be bothered when I work, work, work, work
Bad little bitty in the city that I'm in (Yeah)
When I go and travel, I might have to take her with
Gon' raise yo' money, won't raise yo' kids? (What?)
Tell my ex it's a dub, that's a wop, that's unlikely
Put a bustdown on my wifey, like Gucci Mane, so icy
Okay, don't mind if it don't pay me, it ain't my biz
Got a baby, got a house, got in-laws, go and kick rocks
Doin' too much and sayin' too much, that's how y'all ass end up alone
Yeah, yeah, I just gotta do my own thing
I know she gonna see 'em 'cause I'm defa finna show her
Just let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring
Pull my shirt when she work, work, work, work, work
Make her sang when we bang, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet
If you work in my space, better keep that shit 'fessional
I'ma just pimp off, you a send-off, I don't really ever like to get involved
I'm finna buy a ringtone, then let the phone ring
Promise that my BM gonna slide when she see 'em
Please don't hit me in my DM
I decided that I gotta do my own thing
Please leave me the fuck alone, new fiancée, that's my cologne
She say she like how the car stop, but the rims don’t
Do my own thing
Now I'm , sellin' s (Yup), it's a hunnid ways
Do my own thing, yeah
Ain't wanna leave but I had to go, like Trey Songz
