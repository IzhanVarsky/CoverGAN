Make it known, this loving tone
Of the splendor of it all
Smiling faces, going places
Will never part the two of us
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh yeah
Walking, ooh, whoa-ho-oh, whoa
That special magic from above
(Here in glow of love) I gotta let you know you move me, yeah
It's a pleasure when you treasure
(Here in glow of love) Yeah, yeah
Easy living and we're given
In the glow of love
(Here in glow of love) You really, really do, yeah
Our destiny is Heaven-sent
(There is no better way to be) Hold me, caress me
By a fountain, climbing mountains
(Here in glow of love) You're a shining star
Reaching far to find a star
As we share our affair
Ooh, ooh
What we know we're dreaming of
(Seasons for happiness are here) Can you feel it all around you?
(I'm yours forever and a day) We are a sweet bouquet
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we're in rapture in the glow)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Here in glow of love) So I wanna let you know you move me
All that's new and true and gay
(Seasons for happiness are here) Happy, we're so happy, yeah
Talking in the glow of love
All the people meeting people
Oh, oh, ooh-ooh
Easy living when we're given
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Walking in the glow of love
Walking in the glow of love, yeah
(I'm yours forever and a day) We are a sweet bouquet, hey, hey
Of love
We're surrounded and abounded
(Here in glow of love) Gotta let you know you move me, yeah
Summer, spring, winter, and fall
Sipping wine, we try to find
We are one having fun
Finding meaning while we're dreaming
As we hold each other near
And we'll always be like this glowing in the glow of love
(Here in glow of love) Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Here in glow of love) No matter who you are
It's a wonder, it's so clear
And the beauty seems to say
Flowers blooming, morning dew
Never lonely, with you only
Time will always be our friend
We will always reminisce, kissing in the glow of love
Laughing, dancing 'til the dawn
(There is no better way to be) Honey, I, love you
