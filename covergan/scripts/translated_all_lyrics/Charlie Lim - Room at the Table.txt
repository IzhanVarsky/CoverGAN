But you’re never really lost
No, nothing's ever perfect
There’s always room at the table
When I hold you near
Then I know I gotta be
Through all the years
To others and ourselves?
That everything takes time
When you’re never alone
Have you heard them say:
And everything must change”
May the stories that bind us
I’ll be living for the day
And I know
A house doesn’t make a home
And all of my fears
But I still call you mine
How easy we forget
How many times
“The future is uncertain
Every lesson learned
And water from the well
Can we afford to be kinder
But all of my worries
Begin to lose their weight
When each word can’t be a blessing
To listen is to love
Where our differences make us whole
Is what we believe
If all that we are
Give new strength for us to hope
The change I wanna see
