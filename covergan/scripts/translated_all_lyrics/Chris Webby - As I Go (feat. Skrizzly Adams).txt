And causes fright until the fucking jaws of life
Away from it all so my brain escapes it
Just like you, and shit I got my insecurities too
Y'all see me as the person that I choose you to view
I beg for something
Life been weighing heavy and I'm feeling it
And numb out the sounds that been in my ears, drumming
What really matters, the laughter, I should be hedging my bets
Never stop moving, so I don't gotta deal with it
It's hard to be a motherfucking human
The empty concept of success
Feel like we need it to achieve it, shit we tend to forget
Y'all see me like the superhero shit, I wish it was true
It's proven, but still we addicted to the dilution
I'm full of nothing
Shit, we can't even define it, but still we fiending for it, never the less
I'm full of nothing with a grin on my face
I channel 'em and work through it when I'm on the mic
Through it all, I keep my chin up, acknowledge I'm blessed
Change, erase this pain my frame's encased with
No absolution, what I've learned in conclusion
We all got a hunger that isn't tameable
And hollow at best, that's when I'm going off to reflect
I'll pray tomorrow but I'm sinning today
Got me tossing in my bed with my thoughts at night
Noise all around, ain't no quiet, I hear buzzing
I beg for something that I'll never taste
Or make a makeshift airplane and take trips
Take it all as I go
We just keep on chasing something until it's skewing our vision
I just really need a spaceship like that old Kanye shit
Whether losing or winning
Hard to be a homie when they see you like a meal ticket
When I get wounded, I never get to healing it
The inner voice struggles from a loss of sight
And see it all like
Y'all want that raw shit right?
But I've been all in
I'll pray tomorrow
Chasing after the rush of it, trying to feel something
Well this as raw as it gets
But I'm still gon' chase
I guess it's just the human condition
But as I'm caught in the stress, feeling lost in the mess
But it's the fans that keep me going, yo, I'm living through you
Because the fame is an illusion, the money ain't a solution
Being happy is obtainable, but it's also unsustainable
Down in these trenches I'm here running
