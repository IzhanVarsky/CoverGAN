So bring in the violinist, and bring in the choir too
I've seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
We might be bruised but we’re not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
Presently, fulfilling destiny and becoming who I was meant to be
Difference in pigmentation, religious affiliation
Flipping on that beast mode
'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way
Ever since somebody drew the lines that divided us into nations
Designed to give rights to the trials and tribulations
All I know is that we gonna' make it our way
We been rising with the heat so, we grow
Mind over matter is the metaphoric cheat code
Now think of that thing, and use it to drive you
And always know that, as we travel down this long dark hallway
We 'gon make it our way
They say I'm a non-believer
Lines drawn in the sand and everybody is divided
I’ve seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
And trying to keep my composure as everything is declining
Gotta' use it to pick you up, whenever you feeling low
I'm just trying to find the silver in the lining, just trying to keep on surviving
Make it our way, ’til the river runs dry
Make it our way, 'til the river runs dry
We might be bruised but we're not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
But living under pressure is bound to produce a diamond
And I say...
We all got survivor in us, we all got that fire in us
Political party biases really were all the same beneath the surface
Third eye blind, open sesame
Amigos, who recognise we all one people
We all got one shot at life, and I'm willing to die to live it
'Cause we 'gon make our way through it eventually, mentally
Hey, make it our way
All I know is what I've seen
The thing that'll wake you up, the thing that's inside you
Make it our way
And everywhere that we go, we walk around as equals
Just bottle that feeling up, and do not let that feeling go
Or regardless of who you worship
Change fundamentally, swap ego out for empathy
We all gotta' find within us the thing that inspires you
All I know is what I’ve seen
And nobody is perfect, regardless of who you love
