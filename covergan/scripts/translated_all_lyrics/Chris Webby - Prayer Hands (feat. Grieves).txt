Some of that'll get you stitched
You can take it up with management, they handle little fellas like ya
I prefer when a motherfucker acting like he can go and get it
Holding a hand full of grit
I just wanna turn the beat up, make you put your hands together
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Take the world over like Pinky and thе Brain, switching lanes
'Cause I'm spilling while I'm sippin', every shot is in the frame
Learned that shit from Harry Potter
I'm up and I'm down, ducking you clowns
Then I'm dippin' with your wifey
I been around the block, heard a lot of talk
Pick the world up and I bench it
Every single day it's been a battle fighting off the Devil
I'm on different levels and they know
Don't make me fuck around and plunge
They keep try'na catch you slipping, always pushing 'round a mop
While my diet's been nothing but Ritalin in my hand
I'm out here buying property, you fighting over crumbs
My microphone cold as a bitch
Better widen up your stance if you plan to take a shot
I don't give a damn, still the man
I bet you thinking you could probably hold a spot
And a half a pound of mushy's in the van, this the plan
Any time they wanna find me, I be ready for the drop sayin
Hit it, Quidditch, I'ma kill it
Rolled up and thrown in a ditch
They full of shit, colostomy, get off of me, I'm done
Yeah I tried to tell 'em though
I don't give a dam if you've been bumping at the gums
I'm already on the edge bitch
By the time I end my sentence
Better say some "Our Father's", holler
Word to the web that's on my necklace
Yeah I'm seeing all these sheep around, I'm feeling like a goat
Somebody should've told they ass that I was on the brink
Don't even need a spotter
Then I got her on my stick
When you know that he ain't gonna do shit
That they can come and get it if they really want the smoke
I'm the father, son, and fucking holy ghost, hallelujah
Sippin' wine I made from water
Shit I gotta go see my dentist
From a rapper to a boss and shit, they thought this shit's a gamе
They been sleeping on me like their dinner plans, tryptophan
Keep the change, got my heart on my sleeve like a liquor stain
I'm on different levels every week
They gon' know I spit that venom
The consensus in the game is I'm relentless
And now I'm getting plaques
Yea my skill-set is tremendous
I've been on a level, on a level
You ain't talking in my face, then I don't know what else to tell you
These motherfuckers talk so much, then wonder why I drink
Hallelujah
