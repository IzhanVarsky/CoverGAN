So now, nobody ever wanna play with Chris
They can't ignore the sounds, I'm a warrior now
They don't wanna play with me, they afraid of me, I know
I'm bringing you that sound you missed, that lyrical flow
They see the look up in my eyes and they get afraid
And lyrically superior to most my peers
I tore shit down and torched them, now all around
The shit you couldn't buy in the store, indeed I flow
And grind your bones into dust just to make my bread
Pause
And just the thing, these the cats that used to laugh at us
Ain't no passion for the craft, all hype, it's a joke
And got a couple torpedoes for all these Little Yachts
Steezy, put this shit down for CT
I'm so fuckin' good at my job, I don't try anymore
And know Webby goin' sick a lot, ammunition box full of shots
Why is everyone afraid of me? I get it, I'm fuckin' crazy B
Motherfuckin' Solitaire
So keep on spreadin' rumors and keep on thinking you cooler
As the shit we grew up on dissolves, devolves
The shit that y'all been bumping is some fuckin' trash, I will not stand and watch as my love of rap dies
You just ain't quick enough on the draw, ain't fast enough
Into the real thing, now I live my story
A legend of the new school you're about to see
If rap was a video game, you'd play on G-Eazy
Like it's motherfuckin' Solitaire
An animal, follow my name with E-I-O
Fuckin' Solitaire
This is how it's always been, live it everyday
Like Old Mcdonald, try to follow as I speak I know
With bacon, egg, and cheese, shit I'm stayin' fed
So I guess I gotta be the motherfuckin' bad guy
They scared of me like I'm tucking a sawed-off
No more skill, no more soul, and no more bars
I'm just sitting in my sandbox, all alone, patiently, yellin' out
But I wish I had some friends in this game and shit
Fum. You're done when I come through to take your head
Right now, shit, I see it right in front of me
And call me, a fucking loser 'cause I sat on my computer
To spar with Godzilla, you don't have the guts
You got no chance, like fist fightin' gorillas
Chris was born to rule so I'll ride out the storm of wackness
Why these wack little kids out thinkin' they the king?
When is real shit gonna be showin' up on my screen?
They thinkin' that I'm dangerous
Me, I'm G, expert mode, please believe me
They know that if they steppin' up they'll be in my Raw Thoughts
I can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
And the tats on your face and the likes on your post
It's almost like if you know how to rap, then it's wack to these kids
Why everybody running full speed down the street
While the game ignored me I've been sippin' 's
Just playing Command and Conquer, now I have conquered the future
Listen, I'ma count to , before I break 'em down like I got an ounce to flip
So I'm all by myself here as I play
And I'ma call 'em out (Why?)
It's autopilot when I go and grab the mic and record
It's like I'm playing
But I'm also watching hip-hop decline and wondering
All I'm saying's I don't give a fuck, I'll be comin' at all y'all
I'll crush your motherfuckin' skull like The Mountain, bitch
Please! When is hip-hop coming back on the scene?
Which is fine, I'm an only child anyway
And killing everything until the fuckin' day I'm dead
I got 'em all scared by the flames I spit, and claims I make
Fuck it, I'm raw dog
And since Mac Miller unfollowed me on Twitter
I've been a little bitter, but kept on getting bigger
To what we got now, Mumble Rap, top of the charts
But you're neutered, no balls at all comin' through ya better run
(Listen, I don't need no help, I'ma do this shit by myself)
I've been in these gladiator pits workin' on my swing
And put it in a song, let the people bounce to this
'Cause fuck 'em, that's why (Oh)
Tryna bring that fire back, my time is gonna be
Which is now the societal norm
All they care about is swagger and cash
No respect for the OG's who started it all
But I'll have the last laugh, 'cause I'm bound to be
Smokin' hella weed, watching Rick and Morty
Call me Maximus, on every track I bust
I'm crazy, la vida loca, fee-fi-fo-
They bow to their new king as I wore the crown
Focused on my dream 'til that shit was morphing
How these other lyricists could stand by so comfortably
All that shit that you don't hear anymore
So now no one wants to play with me
That Molotov flow, I'ma scorch the ground
I am the mic, the microphone killa
'Cause they scared to throw it down with me
