I got the clip with the banana, banana
Truly wild, step up in that building King Louie style
Nananananananana
Here to Indiana to Atlanta
This ain't artificial flavor in our concentrates
Reakin' havoc like Donkey and Diddy all through ya city
From simple to complexity that you can't even compute
Drop the kind of shit you press and play and keep it on loop
So much juice that my refrigerator stopped, they can't stop the pace
Get yourselves a cup, bottoms up
Breaking through all the parame-ters
The Tropicana, nananana
I got the Tropicana
I got the juice, that Tropicana
Puttin' on a show, you better get your came-ras
Yeah, I've been the greatest, highly imitated when I drop
I'm stayin' steezy and loose at ease in the booth
Covers everything the light'll touch
Remember
Stamin-a, like Kung Fu Panda, bruh
I give the people what they wanted, you feel me?
I got the juice, nananana
I'm speakin' the truth, as it's always been since I was juvenile
I got the grapes, I got the squeeze you can't touch
Still I stay on top, shit, I never miss when takin' shots
They ain't messing with the mango or the lemonade I got
I'm off of the wall like a flat screen robbery, really
I got the bag like Santa
The Tropicana, woah
To Louisiana, all the way to Cana-da
Until I make an illegal turn and the officers get me
I got the juice
Yeah
What can I say? I'm that dude, always been that way
I'm one dude you cannot replace
Ani-mal, don't let me get my hands on ya
I got the juice like I'm squeezin' on fruits, I'm leadin' the troop
Pomegranate with banana
The king of every jungle ask Rafiki my savanna
Make your cutie smile with the shit I say
