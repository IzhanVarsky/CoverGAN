Even with the paid time off, I'ma grind hard
Mammals on land, god damn, yo, I got this
Stack my deposits, hot shit, cookin' with the phonics
Yellin' out, "Yippee Ki Yay"
Webby dope, ya'll just really gotta listen to tell
And we gon' get it all day
I'ma die hard, drive off, better give me five stars
Say what's on your chest and what you feel, man, dígame
Trippin' like aquatic
Knowin' that one day I'd be livin' this well
Big money, big score, big big tour
I don't give a fuck about a critic, um
Motherfucker, we goin' right on in
I go to Spain, take it in vein, I go to Shanghai
And I wave bye, and became high
I should say, "Welcome to the home of zero fucks
Click-clack, bang when I aim the bazooka
Lights on, lights off, shootin' on a tripod
Killin' it well from livin' through Hell while fillin' the L
It's Yippee Ki Yay (Yippee Yippee Ki Yay)
You can tell the difference, Eminem and Xzibit
I been on a wave and I did it my way
"Yippee Ki Yay", don't forget it, um
Dark side, call me Kylo Ren
Lyrical semi-automatic and I'm letting off shells like I'm jumping on a Koopa
Comin' for your fuckin' neck like you're rockin' a chain in the water with Barracudas
Tell 'em what it's gon' be, new school OG
I got a big roar, big suite on the sixth floor
Tequila juice in syringe injected into our livers
vision and I'm still living irate
I'm rubbin' off on my pupils like pinkeye
I'm self made in the Lion's den
Stone cold like I'm looking at Medusa
I'm glad you came by"
Puttin' weed smoke in the breeze
And when I drop shittin', you on the stool like a pigeon
Drinkin' to the last drop as lightweight
The boy fresh like I still got silica gel up in the pocket
Need I say more, it should never had to be that way
Fuck an IOU, I leave an I owe N-O one
'Cause part of being human is making stupid decisions
Ya'll p? We EightyHD, fully high def' emcees
I'm living proof that the kid is more Brucer than Willis
EightyHD, EightyHD
If you get in my way then I'm diggin' your grave
And you know we goin' right on in
You livin' Yippee Ki Yay or you live bait
That's how you makin' a name by
I go insane, look at the brain, look at the play by
I'ma live Yippee Yippee Ki Yay either way
Better reconsider where you scuba
vision better watch it, ow
And became a black belt at the same time
I'm such an animal, I'm showing up when Noah's Arc ship boards
I'm on a plane, no, I'ma hang, no, I'ma hang-glide
I frost, ice ice, vanilla ice ya'll
Be honest, I can hear you from a hundred feet away
Pull the rip chord, paratrooper
Ice cold flow, cryogen'
Shit, I'm big ill, where the sick ward?
Give little fucks like midgets stickin’ up middle fingers
