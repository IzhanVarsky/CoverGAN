Promise me my friend
I know everything just by looking into your eyes
I'll use it until my palms turn black (uh huh)
Promise me my friend (my friend)
everything that hurt you
Maybe I just can't hide with my expression
Ooh
I don't know, from the beginning yeah
It seems that my heart is caught by the sharp tone of voice (damn)
where to start
Can you write down what you want to say?
I've been thinking about it, I'll give it a try
I'm sorry I didn't know earlier
what's wrong with you? what's the matter
why do you avoid
I just need you to be by my side (I can give it to you)
Without anyone knowing, I'll throw it away
Whether it's a person's name or a very bad word
I'll laugh as much as I can now
thank you so much
you're slowly dying
nobody knows
Black ballpoint pen (I'm serious)
Waiting for me to write boldly
Is nothing wrong? that's weird
write it here
Give me that paper (gimme that)
if you can't tell
It's not the time to care who you are
I'll give you a piece of paper and a ballpoint pen
