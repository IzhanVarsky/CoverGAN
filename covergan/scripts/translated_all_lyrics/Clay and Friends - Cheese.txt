Take you to Galapagos
Everyday is swish on the lay up
I b–µ Michael Angelo
Toke toke when I take off
Baby got the passport and her pair of Calvins
You can call me on my payphone
Making bread and smoking cheese
Take you to Galapagos
Baby that was half a dose
Gurl you are my antidote
Fly fly in my rocket yeah
It's the way that we run
To the moon imma take you the darkside
I be Michael Angelo
You don't need the Air Miles so much, stay fly
She wants to go back to Montreal
Lisbon one-way on a whim
Fixing all her broken dreams
Daughter of no one like Darlene
Baked up when I wake up
Every day is day off
Baby she's got her trip
She had curves like Italian roads
I was Adam she was Eve
Uno dos yeah we going up
Film in my Leica
Form
Ooh la la la
Eat you like a cantelope
Dandruff in my hair
She lost the thread like Ariane
