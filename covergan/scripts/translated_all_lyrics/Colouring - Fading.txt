Am I ever gonna see your face again?
Broke this world we built
Darling, don't leave this way
With only ourselves to blame
It was you always
Say it's not over yet
Cried all of your makeup on my shirt
And we're shouting in your car
I'll never give up
We'll light up thе world together again
I was built by your heart alone
Just say that this is not thе end
How do I find a place to call home?
Where do I go from here now?
And I'll find you down another road
Call it just a drill
I smell of booze and cigarettes
All the stupid things we said
Is it just too much to fix
Is all of your love
Baby, baby now
I don't know how to let go
Just two kids we are
Don't give up
Fading, fading out?
To keep alive the flame?
Oh-ooh
I'll be waiting, waiting now
