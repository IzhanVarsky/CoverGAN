You know I believe in you
And every word that I'm trying to get out
Gripping on, where's heaven we found?
Oh lord, can you hear me now
It's you that I'm trying to serve
Oh lord, can you hear me now?
She's the judge and jury, executioner
"No, it's not enough," you say
Oh love, see me holding on
And I'll say it again
Will you still spin my world around?
What can I do?
If I could meet you half way home
Let the soul out
I'll stick but you want the moon
We can turn bends
When we can turn the bends?
But how you flow through my veins
Gripping on to something in you
And we never seem to learn
Oh my god, I'm broken in two
And I'll say it again again again
I'm worshipping now
Where's heaven we found?
Now I've nothing left to lose?
It's holy hell now she believe in it
Oh my god, I'm worshiping now
Oh god, are you giving me grace?
But what else can I really do?
What game do you wanna play
(Wooo)
Oh my god, this love, I can't kick it
We're running round in circles here
Will there come a time
Does that make the drug? Does make you the cure?
What else can I do but pray now?
Gripping on so tight till I kill it
It's holy hell, now she believe in it
I said I'd give you everything
If I let you go now
It's holy hell now she don't believe in it
Your blood so watered down
And be the judge and jury, executioner
