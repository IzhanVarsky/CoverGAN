Too busy fighting off the fears
Feel like I'm trying
You told me to try it
Like you can be amazed
There's no going back to yesterday
I wanna wake
And I want to sail on, yeah
I gave up the lying
I wanna change
Trapped in a circuit you could break
I'm not going back to yesterday
Waking up ready to learn
The sun is rising over there
When you've arisen
If it don't make you feel
And it don't mean a thing
I'm now waking up ready to learn
Ready to learn from my mistakes
It don't mean a thing
I'm now waking up
And you want to sail on, yeah
And I wanna wake
Wanting to give into the wind
