Tastes like summer, is cool like winter
Whether north, whether south
A killer bride, r-rat sharp
She's rocking, she's wearing the pants
All city girls!
So fabulously smart with a hammer style
She's a Berlin City Girl
I saw so much of this world
She walks through the neighborhood
And fuck it, those high heels are dirty
So cheeky, so bold, so fly
She is the ax in the forest
We love our Dortmund City Girls
Bremen City Girls
So damn elegant and hot
I saw so much that I like
And our Essen City Girls? (all city girls)
She is a Berlin City Girl (Berlin City Girl)
Don't bring a bouquet, give her an allotment garden!
Whether east or west
Leipzig City Girls
Three thousand Facebook fans
Nicely done, champagne bottle in hand
Duisburg City Girls
Now I also know that every city
You order ten drinks and she smacks them
We want to hear you
How you open yours then, you latte
Hanover City Girls
And she knows she owns the world
She's so cheeky, so loud, so cool
And the Frankfurt City Girls?
What a force! Even a blind person can see that
Where are our DÃ¼sseldorf City Girls?
Is because she says "victim" so cute sometimes
Has such beautiful daughters
Three o'clock, that's how city brunch works
And you're in love right away
Doesn't need a man with a two-meter upper arm
She's a Berlin City Girl (uuh)
Where are the Munich City Girls? (all city girls)
She's a Berlin City Girl (yeah, yeah)
And she knows she owns the world (yeah, yeah)
Where are the Hamburg City Girls?
And she knows (and she knows), and she knows (and she knows)
Wuppertal City Girls
Lighter, beer bottle
We love our Stuttgart City Girls
And the reason why I like her twice over
Bochum City Girls
She is a Berlin City Girl (e-ey)
Where are our Cologne city girls? (yeah yeah)
Dresden City Girls
Nuremberg City Girls (all City Girls!)
Get off your chair right now
Big mouth, a lot behind it
She also likes to say, "Shut up now!"
She loves currywurst hot and greasy
Such a bomb that it bangs
And she knows she owns the world (e-ey)
You see her and you know: 'I want children!'
Everyone would be waiting for a bride like that
It turns style into a trend
