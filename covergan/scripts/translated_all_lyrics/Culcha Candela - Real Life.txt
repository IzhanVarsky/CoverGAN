(Love in my real life)
(Give me more love in my real life again)
Know most of my smiles via Hangouts and Skype
I just want a little love in my real life
Super life, into the trends, to the top
Streaming, Premium, VIP, Prime
Don't do all this just for a handful of likes
Shoot the commis heart emojis
I optimize my time, umpteen appointments and go live
Always online but don't have time
I only see zeros and ones, I don't give a fuck
Swipe up and treat yourself to a break
Hold up the card, don't need any cash to pay
The courier is bringing new accessories from Gucci
DM to your inbox, facetime tonight
New hype every few clicks, because the Internet is God
One account for everything and keep forgetting the passwords
I swipe left in the arm
I swipe right and forget their names
Infinite content, I'm not talking nonsense
Please don't make me wait too long
Double-tap your smile on the display
Never click on the terms and conditions, accept the cookies
Always on the hunt for likes
All in the network, but alone
Give me the discounts, I want more for free
(Give me more love in my real life again)
I want to see more than just pics tonight
Send you the code for my apartment
Smash me through the digital jungle like an ax murderer
Respond from Neuk√∂lln, everyone at the post
Today that's all my life
You know what? Black Mirror was sci fi
Give me more love in my real life again
Fuck the money and the boxes of Nikes
