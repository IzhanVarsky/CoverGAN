There!
I might even know what to say
Baby, I can't wait to know
You can tell me anything and I'll listen
We were bound together, then and forever
Believe me, I'll always be there, so
And I will never let you go
As if the stars have started to align
But either way
Oh, you are yet to learn how to speak
Three birds of a feather
There isn't anywhere that I would rather be
When we are together
Though I know I love you
I find it hard to see how you feel about me
And I could never let you go
What do you think about things?
'Cause I don't understand you
We are bound together, now and forever
'Cause even though I didn't know you yet
It's been some time and though hard to define
I just hope you enjoy our company
When we first met, I will never forget
At least I'll be
Believe me, I will always be there, so
