Want me
I'm lost, you're lost, but you know we're not lonely
Head up, head up, 'cause I want you so proud
No you can't let me down
Walk it off, walk it off, and don't you slow down
Are you gonna let me down?
Anybody, anybody
From the silence when I asked how you've been, ah
'Cause all I know is do or die
And I heard it from the rooftop
Move your mouth, move your mouth, I just want it out loud
No you won't let me down
Call out, call out, I was hoping you'd find me
And I heard it from the voices in the rain clouds
That you were coming in, ah
Do I belong to anybody?
Come on and touch me
And I heard it from your best friend
For the love
From the mountains that you were coming in, ah
So loud, so loud, I just wanna hear you scream it
When I asked how you've been, ah
And I heard it from your cousin in the doorway
Do I belong? Do I belong? Do I belong?
