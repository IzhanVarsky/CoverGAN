I'm as addicted as the lips to your cigarette
Hmm
Hoo, hoo
Well, I just thought I'd mention
To adore you
I know what you want
I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
Forward put me back
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me
(Oh, I really hate, I really hate us)
And it's not gonna be, not gonna be
I got a new low
Mmm
I said
All right
While I was thinking of it
'Cause I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
Throw some salt over your shoulder, baby!
Hoo
Ha
But I'm doing all right
It's all right, put me back
I'm so cold and lonely, I could be dead
Come on, baby, show me your favorite
All in favor, take a stand and defend me
But it's not gonna be what you like
My brain is scattered like the thoughts in my patter (Ha!)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me, c'mon
Cleaning my hands are my bloody fingers
