But the time won't ever come if you're
Always waiting for the right words to explain it
Now you're the one I can't get through
Ooh, I was a shield, I was so cruel
As I crawl and I drag my heels in the wilderness
I keep filling up the room
And I'm always waiting for the right words to explain it
I hear your voice, you know I'm running on fumes
Cause I'm always waiting for the right words to explain it
I was a shield, I was so cruel
And I wait
With white noise and thoughts that abuse
But the time won't ever come if you wait
I am a shield deflecting you
