It’s an impossible weight
Steady as the wheel turns
So I’ll just let you down now
Cliff dive broken mind
On my way it’s ok
From the hurry up
Stutter in my heart
Spit it out
I think I’m addicted to the fear
This is what it feels like walking in a straight line
Dragging my heels around
I tried so hard not to let you all down
Picking up the pieces
Stray talk clicking in my ear
Put ‘em down
Stop dragging my heels around
Never mind
But that was then and this is now
This is what it feels like
Wondering how I got here
A million times tongue tied
