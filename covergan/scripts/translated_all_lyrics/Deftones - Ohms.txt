So we slip into our hopeless sea of regret as I stare
Through the haunted maze in our minds
We're surrounded by debris of the past
And time won't change this
This is our time, we devour the days ahead
We've been possessed by these changing times
We shall remain
Yeah, the time won't change this
And it's too late to cause a change in the tides
As we slip on through, we promised to meet again somewhere
Right through where we shall remain for all time
Yeah, time won't change this
This promise we made
Right through where I'll remain for all time
It's how it'll stay
Through the haunted maze in your eyes
