Every word you say
You belong to me
I dream at night I can only see your face
I keep crying baby, baby, baby, baby pleeaase
Every single day
Every game you play
Baby please
Oh oh oh oh I'm watching you
With every breathe you take,,
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
Every vow you break
I keep crying baby, baby please
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Every step you take
Every breath you take
I'll be watching you
I'm watching you,,
I look around but it's you I can't replace
Every bond you break
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Every smile you fake
Every move you make
O can't you see
Every claim you stake
Every night you stay
Oh oh oh oh oh
