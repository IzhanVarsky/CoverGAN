West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
World peace, climb trees, I'm deep
Kick sand if there ain't no beach
And the earth spoke
What a wonderous choir
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
Yeah, we all in this together
Never felt better, never been meta
Earthquake weather, down for whatever
Technique, I'm deep, no sleep
And the people of the land rejoiced as they drifted off into the sea
Well this is earthquake weather
Can't go to work if you ain't got a job
I'd love to go to an island. That would be marvelous
Call it Sword Beach, yeah, vacation forever
I'm a getting going now, never feelin' better
Earthquake weather man, down for the elements
Can't get drunk if there ain't no drink
Inside chilling out, smoking in my bathrobe
What's that even mean man? Ahh fuck it, whatever
Kick sand if there ain't no beach, no
Southside overcast, breezy with the warm glow
Little bit of pain and a little bit of pleasure
Well, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
Try to get me got, get a little bit of never
And you can't kick sand if there ain't no beach
It was a great separation
Can't kick sand if you're standing knee deep
Can't talk high, too stoned, Rosetta
Left a couple chicks with a scarlet letter
But you can't get high if there ain't no weed
I hear New California's nice this time of year
You ain't got shit then you can't get robbed
We can go anywhere in the world, darling. You just say the word
And the sky sang
Toss all the money in the paper shredder
Yeah, this is earthquake weather
