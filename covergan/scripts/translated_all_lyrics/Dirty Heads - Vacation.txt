Everybody go and live your daydreams up
Hard work, it pays off
Illuminate my future bright
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
I love the life I live and enjoy the ride along the way
And all of which you gave me
My lack of the lazy has let me do shit that I love on the daily
"I make a living out of living," yeah, that's what I say
As I work hard for all I need
If you don't like your life, then you should go and change it
But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
Every single day, every, every single day-ay
I've got one life to live, and I wouldn't live it no other way
My life may be crazy
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave
Open arms, embracing life
Close my eyes sometimes it feels as if I go away
Everybody sour like a lemon tree
Rejuvenate my inner light
My brother called me up said he saw me on TV
I said, "it wasn't easy, but right now I'm living breezy."
Do this shit, I love it on the daily
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
I'm happy now, it's paying me
Build this engine from the ground up, now my hands they ain't so greasy, feel me?
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
So thankful for everything
I can't hear, I'm here though
Daily, daily
Get to do this shit I love upon the daily
Van Gogh my earlobe
I may be a weirdo, but this is my year, yo
