Oh, laugh inside my head
Well it's in the blood
Still hear you laughing loud
It's in the veins somehow
I might surrender now
Oh, it's in the blood, yeah!
Oh, seems so hard to find
Well it's in the blood, yeah
But I'm not giving in
You oughta know by now
If it feels like something comes from nothing now
(Oh no, what a ricochet)
It's in the blood
I walk on water now
Far beyond the lines
No, not a ricochet
Laugh inside my head
But it's in the blood
Not a ricochet
Seems too hard to find
Taking me somewhere
And I can't even swim
Love is a monster
Underneath my bed
I'm on to something good
But it's in the blood, oh yeah
