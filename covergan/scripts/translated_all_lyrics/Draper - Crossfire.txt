Fool me once, I’ll be back for the second
Seeing red, black and blue, and I wonder
(Feel like, ‘cause it feels like love)
(Feels like, ‘cause it feels like love)
We see the water and it’s riptide, tidal wave
(Feels like, feels like love)
I will be waiting for you in the crossfire, crossfire
And when my senses tell me I should run
I know it looks like war, but it feels like love
But we accelerate, ‘cause it feels like love
But we wade anyway, ‘cause it feels like love
You and I bring it out in each other
Got my dress on my flesh is my weapons
‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
Follow the signs saying no way hit the breaks
Am I wrong to be feeding this hunger?
‘Cause it feels like love, but it feels like-
Give me Armageddon
(Feels like love)
I confess, I’m drawn to the wreckage
Give me technicolor
I will be waiting in the crossfire
I will hold my ground ‘cause you’re the only one
