And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't know when it started
Oh, you know we are the infinity
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity
I feel so much pressure
If you wanna
That I'm gonna get the bends
Oh, you know we are the infinity (If you wanna)
And I don't know when it ends
Oh, you, oh, you, oh, you, oh, you
