I’m so tired of tryna get it right X
But it seems wrong to feel like I’m working
Saying nothing but you see it in my eyes
If you pulled the curtains the end
I think we might need more
Think now its mind power wasted
Sometimes I wish you would just make me hurt
Never thought I’d feel indifferent
Are we too comfortable to ask for more
I guess I’m worried that it’s me who’s caused this
But I’m too scared to pick our last fight
Convеrsations always turn into fights
I hadn’t noticed till you said you did the same
If so, I’ll put the work in
False sense of hope for the future
So I’d be forced to suck it up and adjust
Never thought I would be this cautious
Can’t focus on what we were before
Keep hoping thats what we still are
To something harder where I take all the blame
It’s true this doesn’t feel right
Kinda worried that theres no route for us
If we say it out loud is it over?
But I think we changed back there, not sure how far
Conversations always turn into fights
I keep trusting nostalgia
I’m being lazy can’t be bothered to fight
Wе’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
It’s true the first year was too good
How did I miss the change from easy all the time
I’m tired of tryna get it right
Been keeping quiet but it feels like torture
We’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
Tired of tryna get it
Can’t lean on our sweet nostalgia
When did you stop running through my mind
So I continue hoping you can read my mind
Back then I thought we could make it
