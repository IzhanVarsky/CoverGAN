It feels like he's reading my mind
And he learns from his mistakes
Everything is in black and white
And there's not one thing that I would change
He loves me in subtle ways
But it doesn't matter 'cause he's always on my mind
I don't want anybody else but you
Just us, a table for two
'cause he knows how to get it right
Just us at a table for two
I don't want anybody else it's true
You know I can't get enough of your love
I don't see him all the time
And he wears that shirt that he knows I like
He tells me how he feels and doesn't lie
Any time of day I can call him just to say
My baby is always on time
That I wanna have him by my side
He can place my order 'cause he knows just what I wanted
My baby never, ever complains
He takes me out somewhere nice
