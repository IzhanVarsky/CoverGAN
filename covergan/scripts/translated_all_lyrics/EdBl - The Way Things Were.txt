Like we were back in school
You must have felt so played
Might be better now (oh, oh, ah)
(I was the bad guy in a movie
Might be better now
I was the bad guy in a movie (bad guy in a movie)
Spent too much time trying to seem mature
To keep your cool
I was impatient
I was unsure
Bad guy in a movie, movie)
I took it for granted
I was the bad guy in a movie)
When you were hanging out with such a fool
I was the bad guy in a movie
The way things were
It's all a little better now
I don't know why you stayed
But I still regret
I know I took my time
But baby, don't forget
But I've come around and want you to be mine
(Bad guy in a movie
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
It must have been hard
Do you remember how they used to be?
