I turn the light on
I learn to run off
I turn away
No matter what day
And know you're never far away from me
And never a moment goes by
If there's a way
Skies of gray
No matter what they say
Wishing that I could free space
And see your pretty face
And I stay for another day
Won't you stay with me
I know you're never far away from me
So I stay for another day
I turn the light off
So I can keep the pace
I'm coming right back to you
I wouldn't trade for your embrace
