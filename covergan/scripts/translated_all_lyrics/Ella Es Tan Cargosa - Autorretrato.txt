The weekend binge
Your diary, your diary, your diary
What do you highlight with a marker?
They talk about you, they are your self-portrait
And the bags you don't use
The easy to understand, is you
Your alter egos, your hiding places
and your bad faith
The grass in the garden and your closet
Your verbiage and your silence
the imprint of your thumb
the tone of your voice
And the chords that you will never touch
And your breathing and of course
Your wallet, your scars
Your library, your look, your iPod
Your dreams and your profession
Your harmonies, your melodies
What do you do alone when walking?
And Wednesday too
The sentence, the paragraph, the poem, the verse
They talk about you
Your God, your cabals, your faith
You do not escape the self-portrait
But also the amount you smoke
your diary
The things you put in your bag
The way you carry the cigarette
