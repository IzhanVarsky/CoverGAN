Calling you up, but you're keep falling back
I thought they were mine but now
Here I am alone again, I did my best
I tried to fix it but I don't know where to start
And all these people telling me that I should let it go
Caught up in these feelings, I know I'm to blame
And who's gonna find me when I’m lost?
And who's gonna find me when I'm lost?
And as time keeps slipping by
But they just don’t know who I am
'Cause I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
And you should probably look for something new
But I’m just who I am, alone again without you
Trying to rewind ’cause nothing stays the same
Gave it all and now I don't know what is left
I fall back into the same old pattern in my heart
I’m where I am alone again without you
And I know that I'm flakey and I'm all kinds of crazy
The feeling's eating me alive
So who am I without you?
I tried to fix it but I don’t know where to start
Only to stop before it pulls me all apart
All these moments, all my movements
And I've spoken to my friends
But I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do?
Yeah, I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
But they just don't know who I am
