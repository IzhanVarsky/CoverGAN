Now you're playing with power
Don't talk to me, don't talk to me
These things do happen
Check the technique
Haven't you had enough?
Don't talk to me
You got to get a hold of yourself
It's the ways of the underground
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Don't talk to me, don't
