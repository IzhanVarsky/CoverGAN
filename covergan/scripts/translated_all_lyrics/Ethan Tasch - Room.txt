I can barely walk to my bathroom door
I’m going off the rails
I’m in my room about to lose it
I’m way to tall for my bed
Been inside over twenty days
February’s gone I threw it away
So tired of doing nothing
Way too high to clean up
I’m out of room in my room
Left my clothes all over the floor
Way too tired to do anything about it
Hard to find anywhere to be
Everywhere I go I’m up to my knees
Lost my mind in my stuff
Half my life I’m sleepin’
My mind just broke the scale
I’m out of room in my head
