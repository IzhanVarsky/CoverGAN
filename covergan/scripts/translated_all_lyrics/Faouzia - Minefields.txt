We're broken in so many ways
Until all the lights were off
Ooh, maybe I'm just a fool
Ooh, what I risk to be close to you
That I'm calling you this late
Ooh, these minefields that I walk through
But I'll piece us back together slowly, oh
Now this might be a mistake that I'm calling you this late
Started bringing up the past
Close to you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are
Ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
Even though this isn't fair for both of us
I still belong with you
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough
How the things you love don't last
And not knowing what you're up to tortured me
Now this might be a mistake
Ohh, what I risk to be close to you
I didn't notice what I lost
