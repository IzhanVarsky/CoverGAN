The night is long and I will lay beside you
Hold me in your arms
The night is open as the sky looks through my window
Don't let me go, besides you know I never will
Me in your arms, don't let me go
What's a feeeling, but emotion that is stealing something greaterAnd I won't decide to leave ya 'till I hear the morning breakage.
As if the truth belonged to nothing
'Cause this bed we've made's an ocean and I lie in it to be safe
Don't let me go, don't let me go
And if fits and storms don't bring us home
While the sirens in the distance sing "remember being single?"
You're the closest, you're the closest, you're the closest, you're the furthest.
She said "I am a wonderer, I wonder 'bout you always
It won't be long, the night is long
That you tied me to the master poll I left behind, it's certain
Besides you know I never will
Then I won't be a sailor
(I'm afraid of all that still)
So just hold
Except you, my only darling
It won't be long, the night is long.
The night is long and I'm afraid of that still
Brush acrossed my brow and then somehow I'll find a way to take ya".
You call me lyin' and say "lie beside me always"
