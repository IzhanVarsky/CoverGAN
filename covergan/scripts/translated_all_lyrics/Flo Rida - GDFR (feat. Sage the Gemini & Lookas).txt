Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it
And I know what you came here to do
We the plus, your man a minus
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky
If you're a freak, then you comin' home with me
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Make you cough-cough, that's Bronchitis
It's going down further than femurs
I could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up
I know what you came here to see
It's goin' down for real
Got the key to my city, it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
Get that ass on the floor
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
Now bust it open, let me see you get loose
Yo' girl just kissed a girl, I do bi chicks
Put your hands up, oh
I set records, ratchets hol' up (I set records, ratchets hol' up)
Bugatti for real, I'm cold, bruh
My touch say it's the Midas
Ladies, put your lipstick up
That auto-biography rover
Double entendre, double entendre
So that birthday cake get the cobra
(And they already know me)
Yeah, my girl, you've never seen her
Then I double up tonkers
My team blowin' on that slam
Spendin' this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M-O-N-E-Y
'Cause my tints by limousines
While you're hatin', I get money
Girls get wetter than Katrina
