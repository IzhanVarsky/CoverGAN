It speaks for itself
The child I’ll never have
To wish us luck
It will be again
The hand of fate rests on my shoulder
Try to make you laugh
Chasing the sun
And you and I presently traveling west
Now are waking up
All who’ve ever lived
Still I get the joke
The young, the old, the dead
And I have lived a charmed life
See where once it was
The stranger on the sidewalk
