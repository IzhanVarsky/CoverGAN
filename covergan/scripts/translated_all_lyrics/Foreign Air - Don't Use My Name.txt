Gave you the good life
This is my final warning
Ropes are tied
No tears when you see the light
You should be careful now because I got my eye on you
I gave you everything that you wanted
And there’s no redemption
I got my eye on you
You need to be careful now because I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
No tears will be shed tonight
I was in your corner
Cruising through red lights
No tears when you feel the knife
You went and turned on me
Oh, ropes are tied
Get it out ya mouth
You’ve only seen my good side
There’s no redemption
Tied so tight
You’re losing your head
Don’t use my name, use my name
Don’t believe you’re that important
Listen to me now
I feel inspired
Don't use my name, use my name
Don’t tell me that the truth lies
I gave you everything you wanted
