Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Hey!)
Will be determined by the things we will have done
If you feel like it's over
My brain, my soul, my dreams, my life
But I'll blame it all on you
What should I do?
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
And now we don't know where we are
You have got to realize
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!)
And you're in need of something new
We've gone too far
Well then there's only one thing to do
Where nothing seems right no more
What we become
And we can blaze a trail ahead
I've lost my arms and legs and eyes and ears to you
We need invigorating
We move too slow
So let's progress
And if's too much to handle
And you think you've been here before
I've been trying, oh, so hard
And I think I know just what to do
We'll be much better than the rest
And we can conquer them instead
