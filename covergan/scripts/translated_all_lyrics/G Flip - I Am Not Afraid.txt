And now you're standing on the sidewalk
And I tried, and I cried
I'm standing on two feet now
Yeah, I have lost all that I had found
Picked myself up off the fucking ground
And I've cried
Calling Georgia to come alive
I'll run with the wind and I'll grow
Yeah, this here, baby, this here, babe, ain't love
It was hard to admit
I picked myself up off the fucking floor
Changing love, changing love changed me
I've been sailing seas â€˜fore you jumped afloat
You know I don't mind that you're out the door
And I've cried (Changing)
But she's been dead the whole time
I am not afraid to do this alone (And I've cried)
I am fine feeling lonely
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
You were part of my story
And acknowledge that you were not safe to love, so
But I have overcome it
Don't care if you don't like me
(But she's been dead the whole time)
I am not afraid to do this alone (And I've tried)
So take me as I am, watch me as I go
I found comfort in what's here
A world that we had built
And I've tried (Changing)
Love, love
You know you're full of shit
Into my world where I own all
A set of wings and free fall
I am not afraid to do this alone
