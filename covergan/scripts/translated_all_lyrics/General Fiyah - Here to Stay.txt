(General Fiyah, watch it man!)
To a place I've never been before
Come and do the rubber duck
Woah, woah woah
General Fiyah on the rhythm, THD got you moving
(Here's another one)
Now don't ever forget why we do this music
Come join the fun there's room for everyone
I miss around come quick nobody tell me what they think
Come and dance up and down
Meanwhile this reggae music takes you to a higher place
For me there's no mucking 'round
General Fiyah, ha
I'm here to stay baby
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Watch it man
Ya purely cause we have the passion for the music
Come on
Not for the popularity, money other things
No room for hate leave your troubles at the gate
To another place I've never been before
I do this purely for music
(it's a funny thing, you know)
I'm blessed with this music
It's my one heart desire
Never for the money or fame
The drum and the bass make you move your waist
Surely music takes me higher
