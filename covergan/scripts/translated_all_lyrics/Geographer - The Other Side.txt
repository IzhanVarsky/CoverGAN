Maybe I was never really yours
But all you wanna do is sing along
But you'll lose it forever if you make them pay
(Nobody knows where we go when we die)
You give it time and then you'll know
I told you once
There's nowhere else to go
On the other side
You know I'll try
You told me once
It isn't life if you never belong
You'll try to try out song
I will try
You get lost in the undertow
And you told me twice
And I told you twice
But you know I'll try
Love is holy
We're on our own
But I will try
'Causе love is holy
Oh on the other side
This is all she wrote
This is all we know
Nobody knows where we go when we die
It's still yours if you give it away
(And I told you twice)
Like a story, no one told
To meet you on the other side
(I told you once)
I keep the promises you don't make
It isn't life if you don't have a homе
It isn't life if you live it alone
'Cause love is holy
