Legs are tired, these hands are broken
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
My throat is dry, my vision's fading
Legends rise
With blinded eyes, I fear myself
When ashes fall the legends rise
Legends rise (Legends rise, rise, rise)
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
It's burning down, it's burning high
Or just stand there and bleed?
You gonna do somethin' about it
Alone I try with words unspoken
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay
We burned it out a mile wide
Taking time just one step forward
Legends rise (Rise, rise, rise, rise)
Whoa
