Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
All across the alien nation
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Welcome to a new kind of tension
Information age of hysteria
One nation controlled by the media
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
Now everybody do the propaganda
It's calling out to idiot America
For that's enough to argue
Don't want a nation under the new media
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
All across the alienation
The subliminal mind-fuck America
