I'm spinning around in circles
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
So far away, but still so near
Yeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself
I know where you at, I bet she's around
I'm giving it my all
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
(The lights go on, the music dies)
(I just came to say goodbye)
Does she love you better than I can?
(I keep dancing on my own)
I keep dancing on my own
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
Somebody said you got a new friend
I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line
Stilettos and broken bottles
It's a big black sky over my town
But you don't see me standing here
