And how we built a lighthouse
It turns out I've always been my healer
Bring the pain
Bring the pain, my baby
Out of all these godforsaken ruins
I don't know
And the airplanes, and the highways
So bring the pain
Am I anxious or just modern?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
It's the future and I'm braindead
Yeah, yeah
No, no
Yeah, I'm destitute, yeah, I feel no roots anymore, anymore

No, no, no, no
Tell your friends that you're okay
I just know, I know you're gonna let me out
Take another picture (Picture)
All this time I'm burning with a fever
None of this can live
We've been here for too long, for too long
All this time I thought you were a leader

It turns out you're only a deleter
Where to go

You're never gonna see them anyway
Been going on too long, for too long

Show 'em what you're doing (Doing)
One, two, three, go
