If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
No, that won't keep us apart
Shut your mouth and put your hands where I want you to (Want you to)
I love all the bad things that we do
Even though I broke your heart
Don't know why I do this
Baby, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
Baby, bring your body, baby, bring your
Who cares what the world's gonna think?
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
They can call me foolish, stupid
'Cause it's only me and you that know the truth
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
I, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
'Cause you know they're gonna think it anyway
(And I know, and I know that)
Middle finger to the sky
They don't know 'bout you and I
Who cares if they laugh at what we do?
'Cause you know they're gonna say it anyway
Who cares what the world's gonna say?
