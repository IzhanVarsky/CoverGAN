I only have wounds
I'm rolling
Beds, trains and places
If I don't know what I live for
I will interrogate every living thing
from the promised land
Open doors
Signs that make me see
parks, bars
But of this
I don't care if I don't know
on my way searching
heaven, hell
Let's see if it comes out who is the one who lies to us
I'm going to get the answer
If the river dies in the sea
