Sign of the end of time you never seen before
It's a fight to stay alive
It's a lie, we say goodbye
It's a lie
Goodbye
It's a lie we
Lie, I will wait for better times
Lie, close your eyes, forget you saw
Hold me tight before we say goodbye
Still I will say goodbye
Scars on the broken heart will never tear again
It's a lie we say (It's a lie we say) tonight
It's a lie, we stay tonight
Alone
Someways (Someways, someways, someways)
Tonight
Standing here guarding your arms tonight
