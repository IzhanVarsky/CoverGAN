(You make me want to live again)
As it strikes a chord upon my skin
When you wake me in the morning
With the voice that's bouncing like a spring
A heart is not for breaking
It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane
A church is not for praying
(It's for celebrating the light that shines through the pane)
If you won't answer, who should I ask?
It's for celebrating the light that shines through the pane
How do you do it?
That is my favourite thing
Have we taken all we're good for?
The party is so warming
(It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane)
(How do you do that thing you do, that thing you do?)
Have we registered our love in vain?
You make me want to live again
(How do you do the thing you do, the thing you do?)
Now you sing in the evening
It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin
