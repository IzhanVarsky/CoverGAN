We've just begun to get it on
But there's the devil on my tongue
Straight through until the break of dawn
Well, there's a ringing in my ears
I pick you up at half past ten
Rollin' the dice tonight
We've only just begun
Rolling the dice tonight (Rolling the dice tonight)
That we might never see the sun
Feel like I ain't been out in years
Start all over again
The fever will never end (The fever will never end)
Going straight to the morning, yeah, oh
Not gonna fuss or fight (I'm not gonna fuss or fight)
But never measure what we've done
I'm straight to the morning
Well, there's a pleasure in this fear
It's a small slice of heaven
I see you move by eleven
We're going out tonight (We're going out tonight, alright)
When we can just start again (When we can just start again)
Not gonna fuss or fight
Straight to the morning
We're going out tonight
Start all over again (Straight to the morning)
The fever will never end
I feel the heat, let's cut the lights
Follow me, we'll go straight through (Oh)
You're always edging up the gears
You're always never, never, ever stopping
But when I'm with you, it's too much fun
When we can just start again
Straight to the morning (Straight to the morning)
