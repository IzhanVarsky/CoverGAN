Holding out the knot
Before we bind
Sweetheart, I'm honest
You’re open, I hold the Sun
I'm easy to come undone
I’m holding out
You hold your love
These hearts are open
And reach out in waterfalls
Opened up
I reach in and come undone
Healing oceans now
New eyes, I need it
I hold down the motions
I'm holding out
