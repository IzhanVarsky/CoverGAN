Do it all the time
Ha!
And then I'm taking your girl
No need to cry
(Do it all the time)
I'll be corrupting your mind
Now we're so young, but we're probably gonna die
And when I'm taking your innocence
We look so good and we never even try
I don't wanna do it, but I'll do it 'cause I do it all the time
Get your money from a trust fund
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
And I'm making her mine, I'm making her mine
One kiss at a time
And it's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
We're taking over the world
It's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
And I'm making her mine
A little victimless crime
No reason why
