So colourful
Give it strength to carry on
Keep on rising, rising, rising
Yeah, Hey, yeah, Uhmm
To a place where you belong
Don't you worry
I know you're gonna
Live your life and you'll be free
Sometimes you feel like
And rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
And you're in doubt
If you feel it then let's go
We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Yeah Hey yeah Uhmm
Feeling the lost of control in it's spirit
Uhmmmm uhhm
Down in the depths of my soul
Rising, rising, rising, rise ohh ohh yeah!
Open your heart, set your mind at ease
Rise, rise, rise
Feeling the pressure
You're down and out
Nowhere to go
And your feeling low
