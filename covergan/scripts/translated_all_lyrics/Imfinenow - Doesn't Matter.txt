But I know that it won't be you
You'd stick, running when the race is over
Do you ever think about me too?
All those memories
Even if I did try to reach across to you
You'd stick, running whеn the race is over
Doеsn't matter if I try
Walking down this street
How could you just leave?
I wish you could make mine do that too
You'd be flying away over and over
Where life is headed to
Doesn't matter if I try
I don't know
To run after you
Where is life is headed to
Thinkin' 'bout you
