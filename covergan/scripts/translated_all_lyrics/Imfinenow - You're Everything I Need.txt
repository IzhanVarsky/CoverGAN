And everything I need (And everything I need)
Do you remember
I can say I love you
But I never did
I wish that I told you
Just to be close to you
And everything Iâ€”
And everything I need
Just to be close to you (Mmm)
Everything that I'm feeling for you
Talking 'bout feelings
'Cause you got everything I want
Lost track of time
Then baby, I'll go
When we stayed up all night
Now I wish I was close to you
But if you want me to go
I'll cross any ocean
If you want me to
Walk any distance
