Nothing left but misery
Sell your soul to envy and faceless ghosts
Unaware of the hate we feed
Empathy
Faces start to feel, unfamiliar
And we’ve been living too long in the fast lane
No more sympathy for the broken
Growing cold to the lives we lead
Hold on to you
‘Cause everybody’s so afraid to face the truth
Just hold on
So self indulged no one gives a fuck about anyone else
This place is filled with so much hate
Too deep got us being so heartless
Overshadowed by the greed in our own lives
Has never seemed so fucking lost to me
We’re moving too fast too fast too fast
In the end you will know you’re nothing
There isn’t anybody here to help you
