Impossible to ignore
And oh, my dreams
A different way to be
La-ah-ah
La ya
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
So understanding and so kind
Is changing every day
I know I've felt like this before
Is changing everyday
You're what I couldn't find
The person falling here is me
Impossible not to do
They'll come true
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me
In every possible way
You're everything to me
It's never quite as it seems
Then I open up and see
And now I tell you openly
I want more
A totally amazing mind
You have my heart so don't hurt me
Because it came from you
But now I'm feeling it even more
Ah
Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
Oh, my life
Never quite as it seems
La la ya
