Is resolve overrated or needed again?
You just caught those feelings and wished them well
They can’t see anybody else
Honey you’ll keep calling me back
Are the seas only flowing to your knees?
What the words don’t show when you’re on a lap
I won’t be impressed in and out of thought
Cus I know
I know
It’s like saying hello
So you came in with me now you’re leaving with them
Hold the phone without saying hello
I won’t be impressed in and out of conscience
It’s like saying hello to what I’d like
I’m saying not tonight
Are you caught up in the middle of the tides?
Couldn’t see them where they ride
Fell off of the map
