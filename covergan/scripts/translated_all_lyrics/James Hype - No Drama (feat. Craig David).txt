Oh, we've all been hurt before, yeah
We don't need no drama, don't need problems in my head
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
The problems in my head
That love is never simple
And if it brings you pain then it's okay for you to let go
You told me your heart broke
In a different lingo
To a different tempo
I've been reflecting my perspective
It could just be an echo
Talking
Dancing
And now I know
We don't need
But trust me, girl, we'll be fine, yeah
When the night falls on us one by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama
We don't need no drama, dance with my body instead
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
And now you know
No matter where it goes
You've been reflecting, counting blessings
We gotta take things slow
No matter high or low
'Cause love is never simple
The sun ain't always shining
A dance with me instead
The things we gon' forget
