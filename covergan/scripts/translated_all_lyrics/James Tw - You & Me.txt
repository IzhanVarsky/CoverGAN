I didn't mean to hurt you
I wouldn't have nothing at all
You don't even realise what you mean (Oh-oh-oh)
All of the broken hearts and the stupid mistakes
'Cause I want you, you, you
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes
But if you knew the truth, then
You don’t even realise (Oh-oh-oh)
No one could get me so perfectly (Oh-oh-oh)
And me, me, me, forever (You and me, you and me)
You don't know who I am anymore
We'll look back and laugh
'Cause if I didn't have you
A library full of pages
No one could get me so perfectly
You're all that I need
As long as I got you and me
I'll always have everything I need
You say that you don't know me
Remembering when we fell in love
Have got us to where we are, it was worth all the pain
Oh, I want you, you, you
No one could fall for you quite like me (Oh-oh-oh)
And me, me, me, together (You and me, you and me)
You don't even realise what you mean
You’re all that I need
Yeah, we’ll look back
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me (Oh-oh-oh)
No one could fall for you quite like me
So why’d I let you walk out the door?
I know one day we'll look back
Stories on the tip of our tongues
Then you wouldn’t feel insecure
Me, me, me, forever (Oh-oh-oh)
I always forget that you can't read my mind
’Cause I want you and me, you and me
You don't even realise (Oh-oh-oh)
Me, me, me, together
(Oh-oh-oh)
