His feet like magic, then he looked my way
The way he moves always caught my eye
We'd be dancing 'til the dawn
I knew I was in for a ride, as we-
Never knew I'd feel so alive
That look in his eyes made me sure
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
Got me twistin' and turnin' around in my Jimmy Choos
(Drop)
Spin 'round and 'round
With our heartbeats beatin' and we
Not once did he ever leave my side
Our feet tap-tappin' and our heartbeats beatin' and we
I moved to the fours as he danced away
We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd
Swing to the sound
Dancing, waiting for that drop as we
Couldn't take no more, just had to try
Spin 'round and-
We'd be dancing, dancing, dancing 'til the dawn
Boy, I'll tell ya: that boy can move
No matter what, we couldn't stop
There's a boy downtown from the club I know
And in one swoop, he had my by his side
He doesn't say a word, just hits the floor
I swayed around the club all night
That guy sure knows how to twist and jive
