What do you see, what do- what do you see?
And now it's only gone and gotten onto Sunday
...so, just to keep everybody awake, sort of, I asked a couple of the boys in the band to drop over, too...)
And I think it's time to play
So, Peeping Tom, keep on looking at me
So, I simply, accidentally, carelessly
Open up your eyes real wide
He's been there for days
There's a Peeping Tom sat outside my window
Peeping Tom tell me
What do you see?
'Cause Peeping Tom I've got a big surprise
(...and we had to have music... I mean you wouldn't want things to get dreary, would you?
What do you see? (anything can happen, watch)
Drop my dressing gown for him to see
'Cause Peeping Tom, I've got a big surprise
Peeping Tom tell meâ€”
'Cause there is nothing more that I like than to be seen
Sure as hell, the Peeping Tom is looking at me
Time to play
So, I slide across my hood, and what do I see?
