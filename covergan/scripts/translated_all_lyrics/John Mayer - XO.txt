Giving you everything
And I'm crashing into you
Before our time has run out, oh
You better kiss me
You kill me girl XO
Before time has run out
Oh, in the darkest night, I'll
I'm giving you everything
Baby, daylight's wasting
Baby, kiss me
Your heart is glowing
Oh, you can turn my lights out
You can turn my lights out
In the darkest night, I'll
Your face is all that I see
Mhh baby, kiss me, kiss me
Oh, baby, love me lights out
Oh, baby, take me, take me
Your love is bright as ever
Baby, love me lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Even in the shadows
Oh, we don't have forever
I'll search through the crowd
Nobody sees what we see
Is all that I see
You love me like XO
They're just hopelessly gazing
I love you like XO
