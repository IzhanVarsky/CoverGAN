He said, "Oh, Jonny, baby, could you maybe spare a dime?"
I tell the beastly brothers that I mean no one no harm
The beast and all his brothers are just staring back at me
But then I realize my trousers feel much lighter than before
Oh will someone please just stop me ‘fore I say something obscene
So there I was just walking down the middle of the street
When in flies Larry Bird and the ’ All Star Team
I grab my shoes and jacket and start to walk out the door
I am somewhere in between the silver surfer’s dreams
I yelled up to the heavens and the heavens yelled right back
Despite the lack of sunlight the reality was clear
Now with one eye split wide open and women on one arm
He said, "Okay I understand, I’ve picked up on your clue"
So I just kept a-walking or feet at a time
I said, "I’m sorry Lar’ but I just don’t carry that kind of cash
Suddenly I’m sitting in the belly of the beast
Of Fantastic- erotica and doing something mean
But I come back resurrected times better than before
I feel like saying something, but before I get to speak
I was currently residing halfway up somebody’s rear
They do the sacrificial dance and feed me to the boar
I’m upside down and bleeding, cut wide open cheek to cheek
I’m not intending to offend I’m simply trying to set the scene
That I’d been bested by the one and only number
A monumental roar that knocked me flat out on my ass
Until I found myself a-standin’ where the sun don’t seem to shine
I said, "Hey Larry man, yes its been a real long time"
And that was that and Larry and the whole team off they flew
It must have been my ego that had blinded me to see
Not since the great depression and that whole stock market crash"
Larry Bird really pulled the wool over me, uh huh
