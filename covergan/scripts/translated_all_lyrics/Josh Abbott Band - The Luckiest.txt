Did I meet a genie in a bottle?
Yeah, I'm lucky, I know it's true
To be without your so good kind of love
I swear, sometimes, it feels just like I'm dreaming
Loved by you
I don't wanna know what it's like
And I'm lucky King George still makes country records
Did I find a field of four-leaf clovers
And if I am, please don't wake me up
Loved by you (I'm the luckiest)
And I'm lucky I got friends that got my back
'Cause now that I've kissed your lips goodnight
I feel the luckiest to be loved by you (Ooh)
I can't believe the life that I've been given
I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
Somewhere along the way in another life?
But I feel the luckiest to be loved by you
'Cause I don't know what I did
Did I make the same wish all three times?
Yeah, I'm lucky (I'm lucky), and I know it's true
And I'm lucky for the miles on my boots
For all my stars to line up like this
I'm lucky King George still makes country records
And that I've had all the good times that I've had
And I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
I'm lucky God made Friday nights and cold beer
Yeah, I'm lucky, and I know it's true
