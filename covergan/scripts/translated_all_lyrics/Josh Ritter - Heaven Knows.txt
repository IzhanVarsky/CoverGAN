Can I tell you how I'm feeling
So patience, please have patience
I have been so long alone
You and I been strangers
Patience, please have patience
Or have you already read my mind?
Heaven knows how hard I'm trying
I can't feel those storm clouds roll in
I don't know how to do this
I ain't got those kind of bones
Haven't seen you in the longest time
Can you give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
