And though I plead and though I beg
In the hopes of only living
His dreams were deep and soundless
A land that beckoned like a friend
Your family close around your bed
My boy is gone and I don't know
You won't say where he's gone to
A land that welcomes strangers in
'Til finally all we had were dreams
Through blood and filth and rock and wild
May the pain within you dwell
All alone in a tiny cell
As if I could escape you
And since I could not hold my babe
The holy family got away
We lived on roots and the bark of trees
By the wall I fell and cried
To the ones who you gave nothing
With fifty others in the back
But as you rest your weary head
The soles of both my feet were bruised
Forever unforgiven
The river stole away my shoes
And we hoped that they would fill us
A simpler time, a simpler place
And Egypt stretched out its great hand
Drank the water from the stream
When all the gunmen were asleep
Where he is or where I am
For death was all around us
With every breath, it hurts me
Then took our pride and stole our babes
I’m tired now, my eyes are dry
There's only me alone tonight
He found me there where I had slipped
The day was long, the sun was high
Watched us as we met our fates
In a land I thought would be
I'd rather die than take it
We slipped into the forest
Joseph and my boy and I
My boy lay silent in my arms
And may it follow you to hell
Put handcuffs tight around my wrists
In the hopes they would not find us
Who crawled the final brutal miles
It got so hot we could not breathe
Ours if we could make it
And you who watched from your great gates
The naked one, the starving child
May your thoughts all fly instead
To welcome them with mercy
We left everything behind
A hammer on an anvil sky
They shut the door behind us
That’s where I buried Joseph
Took only what we had to keep
And hoped it would not kill us
We left our home by dark of night
Shackles tied around my legs
If I had the chance again
With others who had even less
You took my only boy away
Now Joseph's dead out on the road
You will one day die of something
We prayed our prayers, we broke our bread
A man offered a change of luck
When we arrived, the sky was black
Joseph and my boy and me
All we had for a cargo truck
