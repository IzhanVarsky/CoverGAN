Ghosts under the stairs and
And float above that endless ocean
But careful friend, this useful tonic
Will boil the blood inside your stomach
Peace in my soul
Well, I don't know what I did last night
I take my potion
Behind the curtain
Tigers in the garden
Hear voices in the attic
Yeah, the voices in the attic were mine
That everything is moving
Always feel a presence lurking
It spins, spins, spins
To make you run a mile from me
Under my bed
Yeah, the only thing I fear is myself

And my parents were out working
I don't know what I said
Oh, when I was younger
No, I just can't find it

Well, this persistent illusion
Oh, when the day is dying
And the only thing I fear is myself
The only thing I fear is myself
Faces in the TV static
Now that I am older
Well, I just can't find
