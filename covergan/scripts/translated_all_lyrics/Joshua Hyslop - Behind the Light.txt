Oh, the summers that never end
As they break, the horizon bends
More than I have got
Well, there is something I can't explain
There is more here than meets the eye
I remember the sweeter days
Diving headlong below the waves
Oh, giving more than I've got
But it was alright when I was playin' it for you
Something burning behind the light
Mixed with amber and waves of gold
But, alone is harder than I thought
Just my words never came out right
Crimson sunsets and violet skies
As the light fell underneath the dark
No, it's not that I spoke in vain
And the whole time, I wondered where you are
There is something here to behold
Now it's over
In my heart, I, I know I've played the fool
But I still don't seem to understand
So, here I go again
