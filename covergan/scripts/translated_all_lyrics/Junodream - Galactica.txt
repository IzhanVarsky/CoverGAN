But it goes on and on and on
Reading from the window by my bed
What's the bigger lie?
Just to show the scars that're on the spine
I'm swallowed by the moon, yeah
I'm alright but all my friends are dead
The days are always numbered
In my world
Stuck in the screen forever
Inside, I've been to nowhere
Behind the eyes, I see them
I won't betray the system
Drifting on a parallel to mine
Way out
Now to pull the knife
