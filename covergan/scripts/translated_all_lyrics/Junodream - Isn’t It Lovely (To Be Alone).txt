(mmm) I wanna go home
Cause' I know I wanna go home
Leave the island as it is
You know
But troubles in bed, with the dark
And I can't bare one more day in the office
Smash all the windows, tear up the floor
And isn't it lovely to be alone?
How the hell should I know?
One... Two...
And the hair that you pulled from its head
Isn't it lovely to be alone?
I wanna' go home
I wanna go
Honestly
It will blow your mind
And I can't handle the weight on my shoulders
But god only knows what I feel isn't real
After all, All I know is I wanna' go home
Lock up the island and swim from the shore
Talking strangers faded in darkness
She's far in the eyes and it's starting to show
Fuck up the party, let it all go
She said why don't you know how I feel?
I don't seem to know my face anymore
Pray that the violence stays at the door
Night is old the day is behind us
