Did we also fall in love someday?
live like that
We only separated and changed
with good people
What kind of dream did you and I have together
you'll be busy as usual
Those memories that made me sick
we were young then
It's still you
Isn't it surprising
We were hugged all day, have you ever drawn the end?
Will it be beautiful for you now?
I'm fine, how are you?
I hope it can
I let go of the easily held hand
so can i laugh here
We were happy because we were together
