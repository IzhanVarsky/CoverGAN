Baby, when I have you
You say you've made up your mind and I should make my up mind too
You like to get high, I like to be by your side
You call it a trip, I call it a ride
She said nothing compares, she said it all out of despair
Sunshine for miles
I said "It's so you know I care"
She said it all out of despair
I said, "It's so you know I care"
Maybe attraction only counts for a fraction, but it pulls me through
She said nothing compares
When I walk into the room, you know who I'm looking for
I could say you're my dream come true, but there's so much I don't like about you
I don't need nobody else
You say you believe in joy and I say I believe in you
I've been looking for you since I walked through the door like every time before
