Home alone eating sushi for two
If I ask you if you want to hang with me
Home alone and I'm waiting for someone who never shows up!
But when you're drunk and got no place to hide
Tried everything to make you feel what I feel
You shine best without me
I tried to find someone new
You got a thousand excuses rehearsed
I wanted to leave
Why do I do this to myself?
I give, and you take, and I give
Feels like my love for you
You're only giving me drips of your love
No one can say I didn't try
It's like a never ending story
Why would you ever put me first?
But I always end up still wanting you
My love for you
I am forever alone
But did you ever think about me when I wasn't near you?
When you're not I don't even exist
And I'm lonely, I'm angry, I'm tired
Like all the ones I had before
Who's the one you always call?
And now you're slipping away
Is stopping you from being you
Well, I guess I pushed too hard
When I'm with you, you tell me you love me
Appointments, you've been breaking 'em all
You are second to none
When I held your hand you were sincere
