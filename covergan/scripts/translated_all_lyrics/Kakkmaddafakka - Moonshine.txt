I swear you make me high
I wanna be something funny
Can you look me in the eyes
And it's Moonshine
Higher for every turn
Swing around... around, around...
Fire, oh
Fire, oh oh oh
Burn, burn, burn, burn
On your mind
I am serious
I've been around the block
About the places you take me
So you don't play around
Somebody should warm me
And it comes as no surprise
Baby, you make me delirious
I don't care if all is a lie
I can come along, for a ride
And we are dancing around
Fire, fire, burn, burn
Moonshine
Swing around...
Higher, for every turn
I got not her
Higher, higher, burn burn
Into the wild side of my mind
I'm blue eyes
More than twice
