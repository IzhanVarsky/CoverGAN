Say have we crossed the border
Another glass of wine
You need another story
Runaway girl, run away girl
I can see it in your eyes
You need it for your art
Runaway girl
When I f*** you from behind
Another broken heart
Runaway girl run away girl
The rumor say you got one
Looking out the window there is a full moon, full moon
Guilty love
You made me promise that I won’t tell
Marathon woman. They can’t catch you
Hey baby there is a full moon
Marathon woman
The rumor say you took someone from another one
Arranging secret meetings in the bathroom
Stole someone from another woman
Room in your hotel
Hiding conversations in the backseat
You say you walk the line
Hey baby there is a full moon, full moon
But we’re halfway around the world
