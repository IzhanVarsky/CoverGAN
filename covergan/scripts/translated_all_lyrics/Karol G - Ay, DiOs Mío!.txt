I wasn't looking for you, babe
we were warming up
He invited me to go out dancing (Ah-ah)
"Oh, my God, how delicious"
Ovy On The Drums
That he wants to have sex with me, huh
A little dog of that' very abnormal (Mmm-mmm)
And I told him: "Oh, my God, how delicious, my God" (Ah)
Your man wrote to me (Oh), and he told me (To me)
Oh, my God, how rich, my God
Then he told me (Oh) that he liked me (-tea me)
I couldn't, no (No), tell her no
And in your eyes I noticed it
Between bottles of Ros√©
But when we meet, baby
I know he noticed it and I couldn't help it
I couldn't, no, tell her no (No)
you were conquering me
"Oh, my God, how rich" (How rich)
that you wanted and me too
When I left he sent for me (Oh)
That he liked all of my songs (Eh, eh)
It was a thing that I don't know
"Oh, my God, how delicious, my God" (Yeh)
That he wants to have sex with me, eh (eh, eh, ah)
"Oh, my God, how delicious, my God" (Mmm)
That he wants to have sex with me, eh (eh)
And I couldn't, no (no), tell her no
I told him "slow", and he made me tra-tra
And I told him: "Oh, my God, how delicious, my God"
Stop looking at him (Ah), and he made me (And he made me, oh)
He pulled me and told me: "Come here" (Oh; ah)
