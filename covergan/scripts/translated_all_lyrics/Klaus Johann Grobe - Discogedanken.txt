A touch of spring preserved in wine
An idea alone is enough until dawn
Forget everything you've ever thought
The joke of the day isn't actually a sneeze
We thought everything would be like
Tipsy from the moment, we let ourselves flow
Everything forgotten from the music to the tricycle
All the times, not counted yet
Yesterday the lot, today just the end
If so, we only ride the stupid ones
