I could've shown this kid the road
Another cowboy in distress
Follow the lines
It's not so funny, it's just a mess
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Instead of doing this alone
And he was singing
Faster than my bullet
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
As he smokes a cigarette
About a boy I used to know
A look so pure, I could've sworn
I saw his face from behind the door
I wished that
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
I know a story about a boy
It's kind of funny, you'd never guess
