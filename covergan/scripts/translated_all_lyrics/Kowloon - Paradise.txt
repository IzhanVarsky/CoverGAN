This could be Paradise
Paradise
And round and round and
To be found
But if the earth is pulled apart
I'm not anything that's good
Round and round
If I was scared when you called to me
Yes this could be Paradise
The darkness turns to nothing
I'm often wrong
I'm not strong like I used to be
I'm often scared that you'll be gone
Right from the start
It's just a moment
The pages keep on turning themselves
Even life underground
We've a right to some happiness
There's so much life in the ocean
When you can see
When it's found
This life ain't never ending
Living life without sound
And nothing turns in on itself
Imagine life without music
That I'm not what I claim to be
There was darkness in the sky and in my heart
I'm still yours for good
The daylight turns to darkness
