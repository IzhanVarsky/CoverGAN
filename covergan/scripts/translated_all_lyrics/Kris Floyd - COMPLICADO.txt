I warned you that I'm complicated
I pull my hair, because that's how it is
you just want to be loved
call a referee
I want and I don't want to be
You go out with all your friends and say (Yeh)
With women 'that is not worth spending it (Kris Floyd)
'Cause she lies 'and she knows it'
Tell me if you're like this, tell me if you're for me
What names amaze you and fuck you well, na' (Good)
At once, because that's how it is
Always on a gray day, you just say Kri'
And I already understood (I already understood)
I can't see myself in the same place
And next to me are those I want by my side
But fight 'and you're not' happy'
I hit you in a Toyota, in the Kennedy
And, when you're happy, it makes you unhappy
You think how much I think and if I think of you
You're telling me thatâ€”
You like it at home, the comfort, you don't cook
A man who understands how you are '(Ere')
Money in the 'pocket' of the position
There is more thing 'than just staying'
And smoke and smoke and fuck
That leaves you still and celebrates you
Wait' for others to call me
You want your man, not a name and that man
Like I was, but sometimes I want you to be recorded
And I ask for the Uber Eat', I always pay the fee
What do you have to study for the exam?
What names am I, 'it's fine, yeh
Ok, you, you, you want' (Want')
Baby, no one new like this e' that e' (Eh-eh)
You don't speak, but when you do it to me like this
What names be I (I)
Spend 'because there's a guy', amen
When you want to talk, we don't know how to talk
