that I have learned to fly
I learned to fly
Lele Pons
you won't be my addiction
I only know how to suffer
I learned to fly (Hey)
Susan Diaz
You say I love you and I don't believe you
You know that loving me has always been just a game
(Lele Pons)
you were a shooting star
I don't walk
Because I'm better alone
Fly fly
But forget' that I don't walk
That I don't walk, oh
Victor Cardenas
And fly
But you forget that I don't walk
You think that I walk in your poison
Because ours has never been good love
Alone, without you I learned to fly
