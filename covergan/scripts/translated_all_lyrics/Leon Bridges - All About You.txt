Hahaha
But you like
I think it's there, baby (Hmm)
Oh woah, oh
I think I'm goin', crazy
You know I'm a fan of you, baby
(Ooh, ooh)
That you clearly can't see (Oh yeah)
I'm on your vocal like, "Alright right here, alright right here"
It ain't about me (Ain't about me)
That you clearly can't see (Go and talk to 'em for a minute, hmm)
Oh yeah
I got feelings too (Yeah, yeah)
That you clearly can't see (Yeah)
If the lovin' ain't true
It's all about you (Yeah)
It ain't about me (Oh, oh, honey)
Give you my all
Then we should let it be
That's really all I'm turnin' like
But you like (Girl)
But you like (Oh)
Sweet like purple Fanta
Instantly you got me fallin'
That you clearly can't see (No babe)
Messin' with my pride
It ain't about me (Oh no)
I'm just gon' say it
I got feelings too
I met you in Atlanta
You do me wrong, baby
And you know I'd do a crime for you, baby
It's all about you
It ain't about me (Ain't about me, baby)
I got feelings too (Oh, oh, ooh)
Breakin' down my pride (Oh yeah)
It's all about you (It's all about you, baby)
I got feelings too (Too)
I'm in my head
It's all about you (Oh-ooh)
I met her in New Orleans
