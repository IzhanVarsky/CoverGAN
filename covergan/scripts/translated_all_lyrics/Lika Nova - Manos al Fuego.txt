it was my decision
Although the scar remained
Every time I see you
In your arms I stay
I know that wanting was a mistake
Time passed and nothing took away
Because...
when it all came crashing down
What happened changed everything
But...
It burned inside of me
I feel that I lose my fear
make me trust again
It happened to me, I don't believe in love
And if you burn my heart
put my hands on the fire
I don't know if someone hurt you
Do not say sorry
there is no fear
