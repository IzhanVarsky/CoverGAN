(Woo) Gang
Red dot up on the AR, one shot I put a body in a grave yard (bang)
Remember the name, and mention the boss when you mention in slang
I got me some yungins' They ready and trained and when ever I say so they set up and aim (bang)
I'm off the bean and the xanny, I'm blowin' trees in the caddy
Woo, woo, woo
I heard there's a party tonight, somebody just tweeted the atty
My boys are , that snap and they jump get you stuffed in the back of an actavis truck
I am the shit, my outfit just cost me the price of ya' whip
We high on the lot, man I just popped me a perc and I'm feeling like I am on top
Your friends lookin' good tell em' pose for the camera, she just popped a molly she going bananas
I gave my bitch X and I notice she gon' freak, so I took her to the bedroom to fuck on some gold sheets
All these rap niggas talkin' like they play hard, till the flash got em' lookin' like Ray Charles
Still doing shit that I probably shouldn't, like fucking your bitch when you thought that I wouldn't
She said, can you get me some drugs, I'm like bitch that's a dumb fucking question, swang (swang, swang)
You talkin' that ish and you might just get hit
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
Sometimes I just stare at my bitch to admire the size of her butt
Pull up in that Rari' I'm flexing with holsters up under the engine
Lil Windex baby, best rapper alive
She just took a bump of that Tony Montana, I got me a plug on the coast of Havana
Aw, man
Ay, ay
Grab me the bottle and pass me the blunt, hand me that blow cause I'm having to fuck
Ughh jeez
(vroom vroom)
That's cause I am, every night I'm goin' ham, I just do not give a damn, neither a fuck
Look at my life it got me thinking like god damn
Still hitting my quota, still taking calls on my flip Motorola
Ughh, damn
I got the lean in my hand, and now it got me swayin' like
(Lil fucking Windex)
Pull up wit' gorillas and light up your crib
I don't sleep, I party every night I've been up for a whole week
Yeah
All these people go retarded the minute my squad lands
Uh, (Uh Uh)
Every day is a fucking party, I'm doing what yall can't
I'm off the bean and a xanny, and it got me faded like
Ay, ay, ay
Grab my bitch and I'm gone, you know how much shit we be on
Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up
