My fortune told me I’m on the wrong road
Drivin' out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Eating ice cream in my bed
Last couple of months kinda been a disaster
Tell all of my friends I'm asleep if they ask ya'
Yelling at the the loser in the mirror sayin'
Just me, myself, and my stupid ego
Sorry I had to move to Alaska (Woo!)
"Dude, don’t take it personal"
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
I guess the problem is that I don’t even give a shit
At some Chinese restaurant in San Francisco
Stuck in myself with all the doors locked
I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
It’s gonna be another weird month I guess
Tell all of my friends (Tell all of my friends) I'm asleep if they ask ya '(I'm real)
I'm the world's most pointless superhero
Driving out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Posting all these pictures on the internet
When I just want to go
Yeah maybe I just don’t know what I've got
According to my horoscope
Look at my life like a bad before-shot
Grab all of my money, guitar, and a jacket
(Na-na-na-na-na)
I want someone to give a shit
Yeah I could bring the vibe down from ten to zero
And I hate the snow, but
Well life's a game, yeah I need the cheat codes
