Would you like to live in New York?
What a tribute to the Marbella summers
She was seen with two friends
That her name is Vitorino
And in the oath of allegiance the boy
Macarena dreams of El Corte Ingl√©s
And pick up a new boyfriend, oh!
That you like the guerrilla movement Oh!
Macarena, Macarena, Macarena
Macarena has a boyfriend called
Give your body joy, Macarena
And she buys the most modern models
That your body is to give you joy and good things
Hey, Macarena, oh!
