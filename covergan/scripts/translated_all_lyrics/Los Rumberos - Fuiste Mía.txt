And today my eyes are cloudy
Hey, sweetheart, who understands you?
But it's fatal for me, damn freedom
I don't even know how to blame you
You were mine, you were mine
you want what you don't have
And, hey, sweetheart, who understands you?
And when you have it you lose it
I wanted to have you away to breathe
Why does it hurt like this?
And I can't forget
Always
You were mine, only mine
if it was me who left
Your lips taste of the sea
It hasn't even been a month since I've been without you...
Yes it was what I asked for
It hasn't even been a month since I'm without you
please don't tempt me
I didn't know how to be yours (yours)
dancing without you
And today I stay, pretty girl...
I will also be the one to make you mine again
And when you were mine (mine)
With your usual whims
If it was what I asked for (what for?)
