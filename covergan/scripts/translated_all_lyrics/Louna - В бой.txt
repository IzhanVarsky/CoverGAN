And the good - "beauty"
All lights burned out
The night fell into a ditch
I call the bad - "shit"
Don't sit too long
I pass the toothless words of the regiment
Who shakes - he can walk
Traces of departed heroes
But the slave of his nakedness
And of course I will marry them.
I do not succumb to training
And our great dirt
And if I donâ€™t cut it with my mind -
Unpack with my soul
Old women pay martial
I am a shepherd, I am a red wolf
I am a dog god
The bus has left
I'm a living person
They haven't been around for a long time!
I stared the Universe between the eyes yesterday
The dog was warming at the feet
They haven't been around for a long time.
The ones that I unrolled
I am the poet of the setting day
Death carried flowers
He is faster than you and angrier
I (I) - electric chair
I'm up again now
I...
I'll just kill you!
To those who died at dawn
Look, old man, at any puppy
If you, fate, offend me -
I fell a thousand times
Who is a coward - get out of the cart
I don't like too much
Raising your earthly prestige
To hell with tears, longing from them
And I got into a fight!
Blurred spring surf
Closed the time
I love the beautiful life
I'm all twisted nerve
A hundred - cursed, a hundred - glorified
Which is torn from the onslaught of the spheres
My throat is a fickford cord
Our time does not tolerate snot
