Will I be strong and able?
And the leaves are like fires raging
Would shatter there
Now every night when I close my eyes
Like holding hands and noticing
Think I'd rather be surprised
And all those names flash before my face
The afternoon would come so soon
I wonder what I will be like
The way the wind moves in-between
Our final kiss would bring such bliss
Will I be blue, held up with glue?
But I'd hold you close and you'd pray and pray
I hold your hand so tight
My final day had just begun?
I hope there's one about true love
And feel just like our first
On the last night of my life
To keep me from my curse
I hope you're there, with bed-made hair
And in that morning we’d take a walk
In early eve, you'd start to grieve
On the last day of my life
And how I never saw you ageing
About how it hurts sometimes
Whisper everything was gonna be okay
Would there be time for a movie too?
I think I would love the simple things
Did I thank them all in time?
And a body I can cradle
As it fades to black and the credits roll
I hope it's deep, in autumn time
Will I wake and know right then
And you'd throw up prayers
I think I’d start to lose control
And all your doubts and non-beliefs
Through every street and every park
