Looking for a life, and if anything
She lets go
And runs out to the highest place
I know I'm not old yet
Run out to the highest place
To know the weight of love
With a box full of all her dreams
Oh oh oh, this is how the future starts, oh oh
She says, "it might take everything I've got
All alone and a little scared
But I refuse to be forgotten like everything I've lost
Dark clouds in the mind
But I know what it feels like
Early light across her face
To hold the weight of love
She knows
So much time but none to waste
Oh oh oh, we are dust becoming stars, oh oh
It's wild and it's blinding
I know
But I refuse to be forgotten like everything I've lost"
She rose from a rose bed
Just to feel my heartbeat rise above my life below
Sweet fire on the skyline
Oh it might take everything I've got
Just to feel her heartbeat rise above her life below
To feel the weight of love
I let go
She longs to find it, but
Oh, the weight of love
