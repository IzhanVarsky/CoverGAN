All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Ain't got no soul
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
Everybody got bills, everybody got bills
I said my shoes!
Goddamn, oh man, goddamn, oh man
Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
They looking like a mountain (Everest)
Says she gon' leave me if I don't come home with thousand ( thousand?)
And my shoes, my shoes
I got bills I gotta pay
I got bills
I got
Euhhh!
Praying that my card don't get declined
(I got bills)
Yo momma got bills, yo daddy got bills
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
Yo sister got bills, Yo auntie got bills
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed
I got mouths I gotta feed
There's a full moon out, and my girl just keep on howlin'
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
All these bills piled up on my desk
Yo uncle got bills
Woke up and I bumped my head
