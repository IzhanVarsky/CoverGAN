And now she's in the hands of good old producer man
He said, "Sign right here," and sign she did
He said, "Come here, sweetie, I can make you a star!"
Got the paperwork so she could sign her life away
A deal you'll never lose
"I just want to see you flourish, and I know you'll make it far"
All her dreams would come true
What she couldn't see was he was in it for the money (Ah-ah-ahh)
I am your only chance
Those who have a chance will trust in Producer Man
Sign on the line, 'cause you're running out of time
He knew that she was too young to know what she wanted
Money, ah-ah-ahh
She was only seventeen
It was too late now, caught herself with no way out (Ah-ah-ahh)
And you know you want it bad
When producer man came offering that
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse
Gotta listen well, only matters how you'll sell (Sell, sell)
And it was in his plan to work her 'til he got his pay, ay-ay-ayy
Knew his way to get the girl to listen
Money, money
Made her into someone she isn't
"Sweetie, this was part of the deal
What you thought was fake, hun, the money is real"
Got the girl to move to L.A
