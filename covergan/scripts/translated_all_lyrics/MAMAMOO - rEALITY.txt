I keep getting sick of loneliness in this reality
Yeah, actually, I cursed you for being trash.
I have a lot to work on
Shabbyness is more fluttering
I never knew love, what is this
Words that ruin me become arrows
Rubbing your red eyes oh oh
Every time I missing you
I need more understanding
maybe i'm a loner
Let's keep it a secret that we met on a day like this
I think it suits you better
Posting pretty pictures today with only regrets
about me and about others
It was difficult to put the words that were spilled
hurt
Even if you try to hide me
It's really not that simple about you
So I think I will protect my values
feel the weight of my heart
of course it doesn't mean anything
Like a fool, I am a lonely lonely lonely sun
don't cry
days without you
Even today with only regrets, you forcefully decorate me
I'm fine
Don't feel guilty, understand, care, care yeah
What do I do now that I am staggering?
