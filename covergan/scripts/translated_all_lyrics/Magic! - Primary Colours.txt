Can we count a little one, two, three
So far from the past
Your canary is scary
So much I can’t take
To read, yes I feel
Don't want to confuse you
To make this thing last
Your teal is unclear
You’re painting the future
Enough that I choose you
You’re moving too fast
Your aqua’s a hard one
A little blue, yellow and red
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Your beige is a maze
Please come back
Your fuchsia’s confusion
Before I lose you
Creative evolution
Blue, yellow and red
So we can blend together again
Can we get back to basics
Your violet is silent
Back to the primary colors
