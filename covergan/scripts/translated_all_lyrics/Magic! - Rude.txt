(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Say) Say, why you gotta be so rude?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
(Marry that girl) Yeah, no matter what you say
Why you gotta be so rude?
I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her
Got in my car and raced like a jet all the way to you
Don't you know I'm human too?
"Tough luck, my friend, but no still means no!"
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go
"Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!"
(Why you gotta be soâ€“)
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah (Yeah)
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Saturday mornin', jumped outta bed and put on my best suit
"Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still no!"
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know
(Marry that girl) No matter what you say
Rude
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Why, why, why, why?
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Love me or hate me, we will be both standin' at that altar
