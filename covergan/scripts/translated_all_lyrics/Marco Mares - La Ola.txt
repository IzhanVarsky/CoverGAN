that it's only better
That when the phone rings (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
And tell me, that among so many flowers, I would be the one you choose
May you be the wave (May you be the wave, ah)
Why do I react to the sun wanting your salty mouth?
That there are no pains that you do not heal with your mouth of salt
It's been a long time since it's just me
Tell me, if it's hot, why do I want you to keep me warm?
that alone is better
I always wake up alone, but today
May you be the wave (May you be the wave, ah)
A romance at sea
uh uh uh uh hey
I want you to be the wave that never goes away
And now I want to hear violins and love like in the movies
I want you to be the wave that never goes away, ah, ah
Get out of hand, summer has arrived
And melted that conviction
And I want to prepare the table for two
uh uh uh uh
I feel like something more
That, this time, it stays (That, this time, it stays, ah)
Come a "I love you", a "without you, I'll die" (Ah, ah)
The earth warmed us
