This fag is going to stun me with that
From that morning, uh
that I was going to see you
I remembered
taxis don't stop
There's no more sugar
And wake up to remember
of that morning
Do not stop
You went
that I was going to see you
And wake up to remember
under the water sun
The glass of water
And wake up under the watery sun
And wake up to remember
I didn't know it would be the last time I was going to see you
