'Cause I need you here with me
And I need you here with me
You're saying the words that I want you to say
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
I think I see your face in every place that I go
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single word is perfect as it can be
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every day
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
Now I know I'm falling in deep
