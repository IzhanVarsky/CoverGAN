And you think it's her
Falling in
And start again"
Til we throw ourselves in
Love!
You know
"Control your heart
But you said to me
"There's only one"
Well in love you're an amateur
We never would have known just how it goes we'll never know what might have been
Goes to show that we don't know how things will go until they've been
It's hard
She said to you
So we throw ourselves, throw ourselves in
"Although we'll never ever part
"The feelings start to weigh a tonne"
Can we just be friends?"
Fall out with her
Love with her
Well these things happen all the time
And I don't want to prove you wrong
Fall in love!
I never want to see you wronged
You said to me
