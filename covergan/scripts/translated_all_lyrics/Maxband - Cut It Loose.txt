And I want to leave this place
A ringing of a different kind
Looking up the way to your old place
I saw you get shy
I felt my face fall
Cut it loose
I found a new tell
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loosе
Navigate our way through dry terrain
Been a year since we had to get out
I heard the way you sighed
Been a while since we had to come down
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
I saw the same signs
As when you started on your way
You string along all your wasted time (Cut it loose)
Still an hour left 'til I get out
Looking up the way to your new place
I want to feel fine
Waited for the last commuter train
There's nowhere left for me to stray
Still a ways to go 'til I come down
Cut it loose, cut it loosе, cut it loose
You're holding on, but you don't know why
Until the day I die
You string along all your wasted time
I'll hear the same thing
