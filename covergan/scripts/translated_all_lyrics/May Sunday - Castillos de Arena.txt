Hoping that one day you answer me
With the stars I wrote your name
I can't help but want to scream
The scars remind me who I am
I'm lost and left in the dark
And then I turn to the sky
Anyone who likes to look at the sky
It's starting to get dark
Give me a sign, give me a sign
After building sand castles
Hoping that one day you enlighten me
Nights go by and I can still feel your warmth
I realized that you are the tide
And look for figures in the clouds
Days go by and I can still remember your smell
tell me that everything will be alright
the sunlight hides
