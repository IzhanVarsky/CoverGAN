I will never stop I always go for more
To find it
The speed at which my world turns is increasing and not
To tell you that you didn't come back
How many times will I have to make the same mistake
I will never stop I always go for more
This is the flame (this is the flame)
'Cause sometimes it's not enough
I never needed anything from anyone to feel alive
that takes us to the other side
I'm tired of thinking about the words I'm going to use
How many times have I wanted to stop time
Keep looking (Keep looking)
I'm right where I always wanted to be
Over and over to understand
stop looking for more excuses and come
I declare war and I do not intend to lose it
This time I understand I was always complete
I'm not going to stop it
