How long has it been? shall we get into it again?
Hey world, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue
Out of the laundry bin, I found my innocence again
I won't waste your time with my revelation
Excuse our disgrace, we've had no time to paint the place
My dear, come again, your voice is fading out and in
Hello my friend, I see you're back again
The dog is always barking at the mailman
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, it's all been in my head
