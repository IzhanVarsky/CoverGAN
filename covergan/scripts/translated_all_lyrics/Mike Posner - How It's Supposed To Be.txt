But maybe that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, everything is how it's supposed to be
Well, here we are. This is Sunday morning, October , , and this is Versagio and Lira. Versagio who I talked to last night wanted to see Michael, so there he is. Let's see if we can get him—Michael, look up here! Where you goin', Michael? Yeah, okay. Anyway, he is a real good kid.
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
I say, "Hopefully"
I need everyone to notice me
I lost my only friend; people don't grow on trees
But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
My heroes all died young, they hung themselves with fame
I think this is how it's supposed to be
Woah-woah
I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be (Hey)
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
And maybe that's how it’s supposed to be
We messed it all up, now the world is getting warmer
I hurt everyone close to me
Meanwhile, I'm falling down, my heart is getting colder
And these lunatics, molded me
Maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be
The day my daddy died, I was down the street
I think I'll buy a gun and blame it on my hometown
I got a tattoo, it's a joke I keep a secret
Everything is how it’s supposed to be
She asked me if I think I'll ever see her again
Everything is how it's supposed to be
It’s so cold in the D
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
Maybe that's how it’s supposed to be
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be (Ahh)
L.A. will be out at open sea
