Everything is upside down (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah) (Yeah)
Yeah, run it up, run it up, it's Monday night
If the cards are really stacked, if they're coming from the dealer
Oh, yes it is
Everything is upside down (Everything is upside down)

Everything is upside down (Oh, yes it is)
Everything is upside down
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah)

Yeah, let's cut it up, cut it up, it ain't my fault
Yeah, cut it up, cut it up, it's Friday night
Every single word that is uttered from a tower
