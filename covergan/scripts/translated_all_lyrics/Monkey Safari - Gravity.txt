This feels like collision course
And I drown
For the moments we tried
For the moments we fight
This weight feels less heavy
You
Cut me loose
To try
Pull me in your gravity
Hold on
When there's no gravity
To save
Something's different now
What am I to say
My heart grows heavy
To fight
Lose my weight
When I'm with you, zero g
What am I to do
I can't drown
I wonâ€™t drown when you pull me into you
Pulling me towards you
A pull of gravity
Float in endorphines
For the moments we save
The moments we hesitate
Magnetic fields between you and me
A tender and violent force
