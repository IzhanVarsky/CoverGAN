You think your heart needs to hurt for a while longer
I can't hesitate, stay a while
I'm so in love with what you've got to give
Let me show you, baby
I can show you that love
Learn who you are without her love
'Till the sun took us by surprise
But I won't wait for a love like yours
Telling the whole truth about our lives
I know, I've been there before
I've had my eyes on you
For a while and though
(I just wanna love you, don't be afraid)
Is the cure for heartache
(Won't you let me show you?)
It seems that time isn't right, I know
And let me change your mind
We laughed and kissed
You want the love that I've got to give
Don't be afraid of a good thing
Live all alone 'till it makes you stronger
