We will walk until the day when the fire of life goes out
Scars are tingling
Take a hand is a new memory
The night sky is divided and towards the guide
Toward the light where the surface of the water stands
We will continue to protect the fountain of life and continue to connect
The flame rises
If you eat, Yummy
Illuminate is darkness
Blocking is a stiff theory
Broken heart without being able to tell
I'll laugh that it's also good
Where is the road we were used to walking
Graduation without being able to learn
Illuminating is a dignity
Wrapped in warmth
Farewell without being able to play
There is no eternity and there is no eternity
We are suddenly quitting our thoughts
It's a hassle
I try to cry that it's painful
This is in the fire
If it shines, the light will eventually disappear
All treasures for me
I remember the gentle melody
The days when we got used to walking are also eliminated
Toys that make noise and magic that blows pain
Harahara due to lack of knowledge
Balloons will eventually wither or break
Tara Tara due to lack of stimulation
By the way why
It's not hell
Sometimes it â€™s a tantrum
To the guide
It's going to decay while clinging to Yosuga
My dream is a peaceful life
