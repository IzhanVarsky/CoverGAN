We are not identified by us, the Earth does not answer
You and I will not stay - and I, and I you
Silly, falling in love in vain - all this is not about me
We die at night, I leave the party in the morning
There is no that pulse, and where did the feelings go?
We just merge in the morning, blaze at night
Silly, falling in love in vain - all this is not about me
She flies with me, even though she's not mine
I feel your whole body, your forms beckon
While the night is fading - me and you are not alone
Nothing left, just be
You smile at me, the poison begins to change us
We are pressed by the dawn - it's a pity we can't hold it
The night will pass - I'm sad, the chemistry will let go
You cuddle, I just can't run
Just strayed off course, that's why it's empty
Only a touch can save me from death
