Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Armenia, city in the sky
Freak out
Close your eyes and think of this
Just take off and think of this
And everyone is upside-down
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
If you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think on this
If you ever want to lose some time
The sky is glass, the sea is brown
