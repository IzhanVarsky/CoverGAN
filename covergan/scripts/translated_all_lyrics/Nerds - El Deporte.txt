This time I give up
Chorus
I need friends
And I see you since yesterday
Never believe in the way
I only do operations
They are pure stories, black regrets
What I don't like is that he comes out
Running is very bad for me
An imbecile always arrives and turns us into a three
I was always bad
I haven't eaten for two moons
And I don't want more tv
I do very badly in soccer
I was always bad at sports
They are pure laments black stories
Why don't you and I add two
And I can't understand
I like to see your photos
I don't know what your name is
