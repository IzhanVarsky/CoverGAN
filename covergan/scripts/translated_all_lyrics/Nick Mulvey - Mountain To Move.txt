When everything you were looking for
Was already looking through
So move it inside
Looking outside of me
Caught up in specialness
I wonder, who could we be
But she's sick all the time
But everything I was looking for
'Cause Marianne is a healer
Always pretending I knew
Yeah, oh
Begging for misery
Wake up now, wake up now
Give it to me, wholeness
'Cause I was lost in comparison
Give it to me, realness
She had pain on the mind
Always pretending you knew
Oh, I don't want to see us lose any more time
Give me some forgiveness
This moment is a mountain to move
'Cause you got lost in comparison
Was already looking at you
Give it to me, stillness
I wish you could see that we are kings of bliss
I see this world is unraveling
She said, "Your money is your medicine"
We get lost in comparison
