You're not alone
And I won't mind
But trouble drove away
How you can let me know anyway
Oh we get mad giving too much away
So if you see, oh nitrous man, selling laughter from a can
Yes he's welcome at the stand
I see you get mad with no words to say
I didn't want to say
But we drove away
And that's why we're waiting at the table
I'll wait til the end of time for you
And somehow we get mad giving too much away
No more to pay
Surely it's plain to see
We get mad with the load and the leverage of each day
Selling laughter from a can
Open your mind
With no more to pay
We get we get mad with no words to say
Waiting to get paid
We get mad waiting
Where trouble came and drove
Until I heard in a dream how I can let you know anyway
Baby I won't lie
And if you see old nitrous man
And you see me waiting
That you've seen the day
The moment you can say
Surely there's time for you and me
Go tell him that the dream still fits the plan
That I've seen the day
Tell him that the dream still fits the plan
When trouble came a drove
That you saw in a dream
