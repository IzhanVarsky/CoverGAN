shrinks
and the only thing
Is better
It is that it is the common sense of an arrow
I have been told
I can't use your language
Of the other world
let's arm
And every day
Or it collapses
And why don't you answer?
I have been told about it
your language
Our world
Without news
but we are together
Common sense
in the ashes
nothing fits anymore
Know nothing
