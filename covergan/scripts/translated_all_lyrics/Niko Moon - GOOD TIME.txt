Even if it takes all night, al night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
Tryna catch a good time (Good time)
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Take our time when we talkin', "Hey Y'all"
Even if it takes all night
Something 'bout a night this clear
Tryna catch a good time
Sippin' apple pie moonshine, sippin' apple pie moonshine
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by
Makes your problems disappear
Tryna catch a good time (Good time, baby)
Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
We just tryna catch a good time
Everybody singin' "Dixieland Delight"
No other plans other than relax
Like a bobber on a wet line
Good time
Aw, I think I got a bite
Good time (Good time)
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at
Yeah, we try to catch a good time (Good time)
