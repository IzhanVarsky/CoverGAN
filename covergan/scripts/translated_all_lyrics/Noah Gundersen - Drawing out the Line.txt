Looks like I got my hooks in you, and you got yours, too
Straight up off the path, kicking up a cloud of dust
Whеre the light goes somewhere down the corridor
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, mm
Pulling out the line, no compass threads the needle through
How come I can only love you more after you're gone?
My, oh my
Holding your hand out across the great divide
Drawing out the gap, picking at the scab now
Making it harder while making it good
Trying not to laugh, show me where the stitches go
Where the light goes somewhere down the corridor
Muddying the water fucked my mind
Scattering the ashеs, settle our score
Getting tangled in the ties that bind
