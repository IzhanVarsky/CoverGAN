I don't know why I care so much
I don't want to suffer, move on
Now you won't admit it
And in my blood
You're out every weekend now
That you're busy or too tired
'Cause the photos say it all (Say, say, ooh)
But you cut me off
So save me the trouble
It hurts my pride just a little
Burned the bridge and now you're leading me on
I remember when, when you used to say
We could always talk
I tried to understand what's in your plans
Don't leave me alone with all my thoughts
That you're busy or too tired (I'm so tired)
'Cause the photos say it all
Yes, I die just a little every time
Come on
Oh no, you don't have to call (I don't have to call)
'Cause you just keep me hanging on
Honey, you don't have to lie
I see you're letting your hair down
Takin' all your new friends out
Move on
And what you want
Oh no, you don't have to call
Honey, you don't have to lie (I don't have to lie)
Yes, I die just a little
Even if all we had was lost
Home alone again, I'm wonderin'
You're not in my head, you're under my skin
