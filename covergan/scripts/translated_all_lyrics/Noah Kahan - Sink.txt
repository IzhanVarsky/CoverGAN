Oh, she's the blood rush to my head
Winding roads, they never seem to stop
And I'll sink
Oh no, yeah, summer comes and goes
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh, she's the sunset in the west
And though the ship can be saved yet
Time slows to let me talk alone
High hopes don't last me very long
Oh, she promises to write
So she only says goodnight
Oh, she's the path in which I tread
But I'll sink
Oh, for you, I would never sink again
Oh, she is sleep when I need rest
Oh, she's the shiver up my neck
When she goes, she stops to look behind
I know it's harder if she tries
Oh, she hates to say goodbye
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, I would never sink again
So I have grown to tell myself a lie
Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
