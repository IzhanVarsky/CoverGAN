Is anyone else feeling lonely?
The sky is crashing down
I'm ready now to have a change of skin
The day doesn't set, the world just spins
It would feel so good to make you mine
It would feel so good to steal some time
We're so hopelessly faded
I know it's strange
It's getting more than I can take
I just wanna go blur the line
And in this wounded, sinister place
It just can't be me only
Spiritual hangover that I can't shake
The sky is coming down
'Cause I know it well
But heaven's a mindset away
And in this restless, disfigured place
Yeah, everybody's going crazy
We've only got each other
Losing our cool so slowly
When heaven's a mindset away
You ever thought we're not ourselves?
And leave our afflictions behind
Can't get through to you lately
I saw you down The Neighbourhood
And I understood
