El General Jackson, is runnin' on empty
Ready to keep on the fantasy phone
Wander through the night
Oh I know I fit in with them
Don’t know what I'm doin'
But I know I fit in with them
I'm lookin' for a bed right now
Wanderin' way back to ‘
We lost all our leather
So I drink until the sun don’t rise
Dreams, I haven't had one since
Playin' songs for women
Generally I'm a player
Sleep is for the weak
Wanderin' way back to '
Don't know what I'm doin'
Oh, I know I fit in with them
Now we're lookin country
Now we're doin' denim
Playin songs for women
Look, there's somethin’ up ahead
Now we're doin denim
At the watering hole
El General Jackson is runnin' on empty
Wander through the day
They still recognize me at the bar somehow
Don't know what I'm doin
Now we're lookin' country
It's lookin' like it’s years from now
Now we’re lookin’ country
Wander, wander
