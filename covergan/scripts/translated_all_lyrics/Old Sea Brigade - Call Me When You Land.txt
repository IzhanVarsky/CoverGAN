Tryna make a better escape
Only advertisers know me
Call me when you can
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That I'm brave enough to follow?
How'd we get so far?
Don't think about the distance
Like they know everythin' about me
What am I waking for?
Counting down the days
Am I waiting for a sign
Do you understand
Tryna make a better mistake
'Cause failure is a feature
Maybe lend a hand
You said the air was crystal clеar
Not everything is missin'?
Are they always speakin' to me?
Or maybe I'm just falling apart
I'm in Belvеdere
I'm just so sick of this commute
Oh, oh
I get attached to my surroundings
Don't think about the future
I'm in my Wednesday suit
We're gonna figure it out
Call you when I land
Can I just fail enough to bail out?
Maybe I'm just fallin' away
