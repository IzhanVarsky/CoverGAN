Or your shit magic spells
The weight of the sun is making me thin
Where were you at?
I wanna be well but don't wanna try
The mother in your mind
Carelessly me
Took it back in time
I'm missing your touch
It's hard to be open
Weight of the world is breaking my back
All of the ways you sing in the dark
Just need you at home
Thе stars do not care
Burning my skin
Brutally honest but always harsh
The way I've been falling
Are you saving a life
The tides are comin' in slow
Not alone but enough
Take it in your stride
I wanna be free
With everything golden
It's summertime low
Of your obvious tell
Wish I could see autumn
To have a summertime low
All I can hear is my daughter cry
Everything is unknown
Burning my skin, wish I could hear
You know I'll never miss thе smell
You had every right
