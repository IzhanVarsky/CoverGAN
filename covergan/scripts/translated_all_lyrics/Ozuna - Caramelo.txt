Hyde "The Chemist"
If you want to go on a trip just let me know
My love, I am pleased

In a suit 'and bath and' that looks good explosive (Explosive)
The black eye 'clear'
Dynell
(Eh eh)
I swear that of all, your love goes first (Goes first)
He says: "Come on, baby, mistreat me"
I tried you again
That little mouth so sweet caramel flavor
tell me gotay
I will always be there in case that is your fear
Baby, baby
We get carried away
You don't have to worry about what I want (I want)
Your mouth does not lose the taste of caramel, oh (Oh-oh)
You are already mine
Always provocative, single lives life (Woh, yeah)
Yaso
If you fall in love with me, I'm not going to lose anything
He says: "Come on, baby, mistreat me" (Eh)
He says: "Come on, baby, mistreat me" (Miss me)
She is 'an angel but she if she tempts her' and 'hot, fire
If you fall in love with me, I'm not going to lose anything (Woh-oh)
Always high, no flight needed
Ozuna
'TÃ¡ so hard that like her every hundred years they are born
Tainy
Come on, come kill me
Come on, come on, come kill me
She kills me whenever she does it to me (She does it to me)
If you want to go on a trip, just let me know (Woh)
Even though I can't, I'm curious (Curiosity)
There are parents who throw me but in flow it gives them class'
Although I don't intend to stay, it gives me a little anxiety (Oh-oh)
You are my bandit and I am your bandit, oh
Woh-oh-oh-oh (Tell me, ma')
Your mai' and your pai' stole all the base
And e' that in life everything is possible, be it good or be it bad (Be it bad)
Every Sunday sport with all the Adida combi
She is very attractive, she turns on the sativa
I will always be your bandolero (Bandolero)
But I can live with the guilt that at least one more time (Baby)
