It gonna be alright, alright
Alright, alright
I can hear you loud and clear
You know some people never change their minds
Even when you try to bring me down
Well either way we're gonna be just fine
Two steps forward, ten steps back
Things will be alright
It feels like you don't want me here
Killing us dead, Black lives don't matter
(Everything's gonna be alright)
It will be alright, alright
You see, I'm still here, let me adjust my crown
