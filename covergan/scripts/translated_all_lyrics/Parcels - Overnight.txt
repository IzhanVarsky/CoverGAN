It’s all I've said and done
The reason for no more
Slow down, never
I know now, I know better
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
I will stand, as I've won again
Go back under
I need it more than ever
It’s overnight
Overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing
Fall in, be gone
Go back, I want
So bad to hold you back
Hope that I fall on the track
