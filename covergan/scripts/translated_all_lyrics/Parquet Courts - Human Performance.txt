That you are leaving
There's no suspicion, no hesitation
Shield like a house closing its doors
So few are trials when a life isn't lonely
It never leaves me, just visits less often
Indeed I do know
Sink full of dishes and no trouble believing
Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Asks me do I realize what I'd done and who I'd done to
Those pristine days I recall so fondly
And now if only
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
I'd never felt it, I'd never heard it
Mid-sentence tremors, mind at its weakest
First saw you the way I see you now, through these eyes
Believing through the eyes of sure adoration
Phantom affection gives a human performance
It isn't gone and I won't feel its grip soften
No music plays and nothing moves without drifting
Breathing beside me, feeling its warmness
Into a memory
Busy apartment, no room for grieving
Waiting to retry
I know I loved you, did I even deserve it
When you returned it?
Without a coffin
One way of shaking off the thoughts that it sleeps with
In walks the darkness, I pitch without you
I know exactly where I was when I
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours
Ashtray is crowded, bottle is empty
