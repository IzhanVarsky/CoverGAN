You flirt with him, you're a street urchin and I like him
Your hand in my hand, we escape from everything
Your hand and my hand from everything we escape
To feel the sand on your feet
Four hugs and a coffee, I just woke up
To play like children, give us love, like the first time
That I looked at you, I knew that I would be at your feet, since they touched
The entire Caribbean sea, watching your waist
That nothing is needed if we are walking together
Let's go to the beach, to cure your soul
Slow and happy, facing the wind
Close the screen, open the Medal
Together watch the sun go down
And when I looked at you I remembered that I already found everything
So that the sun paints our skin
That nothing is needed if we are together walking (Together tripping)
You flirt with him, you are a scout
That nothing is needed if we are together dancing
Calm down, my life, calm down
