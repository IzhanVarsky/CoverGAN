Only your memories
After all, the royal fern was rolled up
The dream was already cold
I received a letter
I can't even solve it on a computer
But from the last country
Of tears spilling
{Verse}
Endless sea of ​​rays
I was holding my heart
Someday from one country
So I have to go
The whole universe is magical
Even chance is fate
Hikari of life that stops
Play Play Play Regenerate
I was looking for meaning
Since the genuine future
I'm heading with all my heart
I still remember
I want to live the maximum limit
When I was a person
I have to go right away
