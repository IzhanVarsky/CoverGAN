Decades in, you wake up all in a daze
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
But we're still here by your side
But I don't wanna play this part alone
But we're built to last and run the course
There's no one coming home tonight
This one's for the team, this one is yours
And all gold that glitters but it's mine
Yet all of the goals so far away
It might be a bumpy ride
It's a dream, it's a dream
Hey, man, we gonna rein it in
We can rise above, unwise and unkind
It's a team, it's a team
And we're gonna rein it in
I'm out here on my own tonight
Time's a thief, a hardened act to defeat
Clear out the cobwebs of the mind
I'm the keeper of the scene
Keep a close watch on the good thing you found
Leave all the pettiness behind
