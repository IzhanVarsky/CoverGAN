Shining in your shadow
Always expecting to end up alone
What you talking about?
Five years as your understudy
I was on time but you turned up later
Tell me why I need permission
How could I sink this low?
I'm drying off in the aftermath
No, I can't understand what you talking about
You used to be my hero
You raise a toast for your setting son
Our acquaintance has been so-so
I can't understand what you talking about
When I can't understand what you talking about
Tell the truth and I'll be gone
You don't have to shout
Though I rate myself as zero
Tell me lies and I will listen
Cap in hand, waiting for my saviour
Now you're just another boss
I got a message to you
All the anger left my body
Cause I can't follow through
And I can't understand where my patience gone
