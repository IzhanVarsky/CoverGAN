I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you?
I just can't stop all your loving
I can't stop when you're with me
(Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop)
The things that I, I wanna say?
And never reach the finish line
(Can't stop, I just can't stop all your loving)
It feels so real
Why do I always push away
Why do I always, push away
Can't stop your loving
I can't stop your loving (I can't stop it)
Don't wanna be lost boys
Oh, can't stop your loving
Can't stop when you're with me
More than love I've felt before
History, keeps ourselves from moving on
With you, this feels like the first time
I can't stop your loving
(Never each the finish line)
I can't stop, you're playing with me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will try to keep you satisfied
Don't wanna be sad again
And can you believe me when I say
And I know now there is love
