Crackin' ice in a soda
I don't remember which train I caught
But someone woke me up two stops short
Like a knife, really cut through
During all those years away, oh
With no bag, no clue
Everyday, think I seen your face
'Til the last glass breaks
'Cause I'm alright
No regrets when I walked away
Can't let the memory fade
Walking home in the pouring rain
But they've been creeping back everyday
No love, no life
Like a knife in a cut through
Through streets don't lie
Making money, not making time
So give me that cold fire
I'm running blind
Gotta chase those thoughts away, oh
Can't let ambition fade
When you give me that true fire
Everyday, think I seen you
These streets don't lie
Tryna tell myself nothing's changed
Up on the mantle, those trophy wives
