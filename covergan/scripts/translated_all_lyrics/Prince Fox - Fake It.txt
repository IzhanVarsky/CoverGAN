One more night
So close I hear you, I smell your perfume
But I could watch you fall in love a hundred times and still feel nothing
Four feet behind me, you're talking to somebody new
(Two, three)
That I could watch you fall in love a times and still feel nothing
But if you turn around and I drink all this down
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
And I know it's nothing real but for fun I don't need feels
'Cause I don't miss you, I just miss having something
Fake it
Too many chances though, I thought that you knew
Maybe faking it isn't making it any easier
I know you miss me, you said that you do
Easier on me
