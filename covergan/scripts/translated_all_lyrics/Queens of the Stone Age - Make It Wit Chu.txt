But mostly it's the same
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon
And I just can't recall what started it all
That jus' ain't my thing
(Again and again)
Or how to begin in the end
The only thing I know for sure
You wanna know if I know why?
Is what I wanna do
Again and again, again and again
(Whooo)
Or how one becomes two
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
Anytime, anywhere, and I say babe
(Anytime, anywhere)
(Again and again and again and again and again)
I'd be untrue
(Yeah)
I ain't here to break it
Don't understand the evil eye
I can't say that I do
Just see how far it will bend
Sometimes the same is different
These mysteries of life
