Hoi, we're not flying anywhere
Nothing to visit
Only we are not sad here
I have enough, in kind
So be it, I won't be angry
This small square
Everything is on our conscience
To keep the virus from spreading
In the closet and on the balcony
Home is better anyway
Bored new clothes
Mutim dances even at a distance
See you online
Positive is our best vitamin
I'll make a video on TikTok
And I'm at home, at home, at home, at home
I'll go wash the dishes
Let me go I want to dance
Make up even for a photo
We will sit, we will sit
Looks like gray hair
Now cleaned up in the house
Wear a pillow dress
And we'll wait until summer
And we are Russian quarantine
Everyone is calm, in self-isolation
Let's go to the store right away
And walk the dog
TV shows, games, sleep
My dance floor is a bed
Brighten up this quarantine
