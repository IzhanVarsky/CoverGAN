We are growing further apart
And I'm looking and I feel bad
tell me where
she looks at you
you just stay here
I don't get it, it was so beautiful, not normal anymore, everyone
We continue to grow as far as you can call it
So drink your beer
The atmosphere suddenly becomes so serious
Then I'll go home
Go in, sit down and have a drink then
What an idea, what a plan, oh damn man
That we whine, that we whine
Did I lose it, or did I leave something somewhere?
Come on let's go to my house
Soul alone through stubbornness
Your presence disappears
What are we still doing here
Now that the door has closed
Maybe she likes you
Come on let's go to my house
But in the same language
How quickly time can break
And you her, so each other and you can laugh a little there
And then we go to our house
There is always a choice
What we forget when swearing
It's already late isn't it
Why am I so nervous
All life on the shovel, looking for a dream story
My world just gets smaller
In the rut of so many years
Do you still want your beer
