Light me up, light me up when you feel the urge baby
For breaking my heart, you know exactly how to make me choose
Put the pedal to the floor, come on let's go
Not a day went by I didn't dream about this night
We can always take the long ride home
Let's give it another try
So let’s light it up
We're racing the daylight
It's like a bomb went off, and I think just maybe
It's so much simpler than this
Cause it's a Gunpowder kinda love
Gunpowder
Like no one is watching, no one is watching
I've got that burnin' like a fire
I know exactly what you want from me
Let’s fire it off tonight, fire it off tonight
We're the only ones here tonight
We're gonna light this fuse
The way we're blowin' it up, makes me think just maybe
We'll rock it out till the sun comes up
It's not what you think it is
It’s a give and take kind of situation
You've got that look in your eye
Cause it's a gunpowder kinda love
So pull the trigger, pull the trigger
How do they do it so well
Light me up, light me up I'm feelin crazy
Give it to me
I love that Gunpowder smell
I've got a sickness that won't go away
Believe the words that I say
The Gunpowder makes me feel this way
We've got the pedal to the floor
Round two, I find, myself, thinkin' about you
We can count on the red and blue
And set it off like there's no tomorrow
Light the candles and we'll talk it up
