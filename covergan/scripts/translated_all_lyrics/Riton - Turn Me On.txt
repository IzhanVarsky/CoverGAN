(Doctor Love, you know just what I needed)
And just give me some love
Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love
I can never dim the lights again
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
But my heart, it was made of stone
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
'Cause I need some more of your healing
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
But all that glows ain't always gold
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
Doctor Love
Living life all wrong
