You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You got everything I want
My morning sun...
My morning sun
The only one, the only one, yeah
You were born a star
Ooh, yeah, I got the feeling
You are the one, good and naughty
But now you're my midnight moon
Didn't know you could do
In all the right places
It turns out that this feeling
Yeah, and I got the feeling
Twenty different smiles
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one that calls me papi
And my morning sun
I thought that this love affair
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun
And twenty more when you're naked
You're the only one
Every night, you do something
You are the one, so why stop it?
Would only last one night
I wake up holding on to you
I wake up smiling next to you
I want rest of my life
My morning sun, ooh
