Will shine once more, oh
Maybe this Christmas, maybe this Christmas
In heavenly peace, grateful at least
Maybe this Christmas
Deeper than ever before
Someone we love, someone we've lost
And maybe forgiveness will ask us to call
Maybe the star that shone before
Maybe this year love will appear
For the love we've been shown in the past, oh
And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
For reasons we can’t quite recall
Maybe there’ll be an open door
Maybe this Christmas will mean something more
