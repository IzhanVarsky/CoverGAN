Feels like I'm home
Feels like I'm home, home, how
Nowhere to be
Oooooo,oooooo,ooooooo
Laughing wild eyes
Turning the key
Wrapped in a moment
Never stop wondering, how I could be
Breathing a life
Somewhere to run to
I finally saw it, waiting for me
Home, home, home
Feels like I'm home, home, home
It's been too long, long, long
Smile like a blanket
Life in a locket
