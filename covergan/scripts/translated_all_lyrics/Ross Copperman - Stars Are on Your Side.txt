And that all is never lost
Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light
Know you're bound for glory
Yeah, the stars are on your side
'Cause the stars are on your side
The life you're livin' dreamed
That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find
Sometimes you need fire to see the other side
Just exhale
Sometimes you need fire to see through the other side
If you're holdin' breath, tired and you're frail
If you're ever broken, there's always an open door
No mater the cost
So get up off your knees, hope is still alive
A beacon towards the shore
Somewhere past tomorrow is better than it seems
