Alone and crying, crying
I thought that I was over you
You couldn't tell
Over you
Oh, you wished me well
You held my hand so tight
Left me standing all alone
But I saw you last night
But, darling, what can I do?
As you stopped to say, "Hello"
Crying over you
And from this moment on
For you don't love me
I could smile for a while
And I'll always be
I was alright for a while
It's hard to understand
I love you even more
Crying, crying
Yes, now you're gone
I'll be crying, crying
When you said, "So long"
Can start me crying
Yeah, I'm crying, crying
But it's true, so true
But the touch of your hand
Than I did before
That I'd been crying over you
