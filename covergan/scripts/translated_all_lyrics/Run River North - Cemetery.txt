Everybody needs a way to hold on
Of what is and what isn't allowed?
Somehow I wish I could slow the whole world down
Is it crazy if we stay here all night long?
Was it Tuesday in the summer
But now I'm wishing I could slow the whole world down
It's a feeling that we both know too well
This day started ordinary
Out of fear that we may break the spell
When you started sleeping on my couch
Midnight in the cemetery
Just a little bit
Last night started ordinary
Good intentions, empty handed
Longer
But now I'm wishing I could slow thе whole world down
And I lost track of the details
Hesitating with commitment
Is it crazy if we stay herе all night long?
Sunrise in the cemetery
