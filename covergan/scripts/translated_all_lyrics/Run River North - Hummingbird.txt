I can't explain how much this...
You're losing morе than what you're worth
It's inevitable, it's inevitable
Every second's getting worse
There's not a next time, just a flat line
(I can't explain how much this hurts)
I'm in love with the summer set rays
Can't take this with me, why?
(Say you told me so, say you told me so
(Every second's getting worse)
I can't explain how much it hurts
Light speed at the crack of dawn
But I see no faults, I fall, I'm falling, falling
Don't leave me hanging on this line
Can't take this with me, why?)
I'll go until you call just
Someone cut me off one more lane
Hummingbird with the high beams on
Hummingbird with the high bеams on
(I can't stand to see you falling)
I can't explain how much this hurts
I can't stand to see you falling
You're losing more than what you're worth
