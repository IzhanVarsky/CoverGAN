You know what I'd do for you
What we said
But next time that I call I'm hopin' that you answer me
I know what you'd do for me
Feelin' lonely in this room since I was
Thought this bottle was supposed to drown my memory
We should have been
You will see
Maybe I'm a fool
When we were
Dressed in sunlight, warmed the cold
Maybe I'm a fool for you
I'm looking for the place
The truth in me
That lived inside me
At the top of Cherry Hill
Where I was falling into you
But I'm still swimmin' in your vision and it's temptin' me
