You just fucking up the murder rate
Djsfahladsjfhlasdkjf
Pretty face gets her what she wants
Hope Im not the lick
That opportunist smell didn't take long to permeate
You're just what I want
So she hears somebody wants some weight
Im tryna' put her in her place and tell her
And go and hide
I'm nervous wait
And of course they wanna' cop from her
But pump yo brakes and lift yo tongue up
You gassed cause you ride around bussin' come ups
Even freedom from the local cops
Cause we're about to hit a lick
Lick
Look both ways before you crossin' me
She's illegal so she's selling yay
I could feel you from across the street
Cameras on its lit
Cause Im not the lick
All alone livin' in the A
Stop killing these dreams
So she tells her homies time to ride
