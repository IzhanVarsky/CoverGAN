The outcome of my input is my favorite review
Russ is the wave, nah, Russ the tsunami
Ain't no playin us, we were born to make a dent
The money ain't as fun when you're the only one with it
I beat the game and I ain't even use a cheat code
I need a smaller table and a bigger fence
This is what you get when you don't care about the party scene
I chew my beats and I spit out anthems
I move around with a handful of people that know they worth
Making hooks like lay ups and verses like free throws
We understand that there's way more to life than just paying rent
Oh that's crazy talk ain't it?
This is for my Spanish girls in Brooklyn screaming, "Papi"
Lemme tell you how my life feel
Whole album fire, I might call the shit, "Pyro"
I'm in my own league, though
I suggest you listen when I talk and shut your mouth
Think they repo-ing the cars, think we gotta sell the couch
I know what I gotta do to make my mom stop crying
Too young for this wisdom, make them wanna check ID, though
I been psychic, motherfuckers doubted
What you gonna do if they don't send a boat
Everybody's in the same game, different levels with it
I could go to Saudi, make racks a night
Am I the only one lifted?
Yeah, I pay my dues and get paid for it, too
I'm just shootin' for the masses like I'm tryna make the news
Better learn to swim lil' guppy
It's very evident I know some shit you don't
About your magazine it means nothing
But speaking of rent, I think we bout to lose the house
If you wanna stand out gotta be outstanding
Feelin star struck every time I see my face
Top prospect, projected high draft pick
I'm just gassed off my drive, though
mics use to mean something, nowadays I don't give a fuck
So pardon me if I don't really look amused
Own my own team, though
Think they cuttin' off the lights, think they turnin' off the water
Trying times doesn't mean it's time to stop trying
I do the work of two and half men like Charlie Sheen
This past year has felt like a high light reel
I change the world by example, not by my words
By the time this comes out, it's probably times the price
Te quieres casar conmigo, yeah, they want me
I see these leeches campin' out, it's like they live in tents
I should do a deal with a Nike 'cause these checks are comin' soon, ooh
You hatin' from the stands, I'm ballin out, peep the seats, though
All this winning by myself, got these labels all confused
I'm flying with wings that grew from leaps of faith
And I'm still turnin' down every single label offer
Same hell, different devils with it, yeah
I'm too advanced for your advances, man, I'm feelin godly
