You do it again, again, again, again
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you
By the time realized, we grew old like this in a flash and so
Always left one more step to catch you,catch you, catch you, catch you
Until I come back to earth to see you again
You do it again, again, again, again, again
Soredemo
I’ll make a tiny tea room for you-ou-ou
If I could come back
How do we feel
Aitowa
Aitowa (Aitowa)
How do we do
By the time realized, it’s time to say goodbye, my life
If we never find each other cause both have bad eyesight
On the earth once again
