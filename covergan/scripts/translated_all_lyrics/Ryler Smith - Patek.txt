With subtle maneuvers we taking the tip of the berg
Cousin verbally equipped son they love my function
Too dirty to groove with it
Raising it up, the name public I summoned it
Fuck your fake ass persona trace up no honor
In those subways and busses uh
Ain't got no time for slow
Bust it spread the mustard
This shit for old school hustlers
Addicted like speed
Found a new source of peace of mind
Style irregular smoke the stash up presto
Sauce we whip it like pesto
From south of London to Shanghai
All of my people they part of it
Never finesse low (that's known)
Rappers get pushed back further no mercy
See us get bigger with every bid that biddin' up
Splittin the crumbles
Tried to force it that shit was useless
I'm crazy so fuck with it
With the armada always on time like patek
Stylin' on point you see no gold on my neck uh
I'm tipping no scale for these petty odds
Poppa always said money gon' turn most peeps to greed
They get heated like saunas
Uh huh
From Harlem around the whole globe back up to New Jersey
Gotta be clean or be bitter up on the rough
Livin off pennies why we remain humble
Shit ain't all prada or gucci
Y'all acting like petty toddlers
Like dials right on the patek watch
Gotta be said that contenders consuming him
When you forced a blue collar
Ain't got no time for those
As we go to Bentley's from Honda's
In the jungle plenty snakes and piranhas try to slump you
Make sure my mind my own
Now I don't need excuses fuck y'all
Ain't a man who been depending on better luck
Y'all want the new wave I'm giving em numerous
Bust out the lewis a sudden intuitive feeling
Niggas too dramatic always on point now partner
Make sure these dials ain't wrong
Trades of no customs stay bumpin'
Eat up at Benihana's
