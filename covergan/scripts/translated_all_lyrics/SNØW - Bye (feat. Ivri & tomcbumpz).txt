Thinking your chest isn't part of my stuff
I wish I'd known, I fell in love with the feelings
I saw all my friends disappearing, what have you done?
Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting?
While you living life without meaning
Too many secrets I'll take to my grave
Nobody cares, that's why they don't call
Now I'm gonna drown, drown
I don't need closure
Drown to my end
Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting
Such a big world, I always feel small
No, I do not wanna sin
Wish I can fly away, wish I can be in another place
No, I do not wanna spark
Maybe that's why he isn't listening yeah, yeah
Really wanted to be safe but I'll accept my fate, yeah
My demons, they lurk in the dark
I feel like heaven's so far, yeah
Was it my fault?
I need you to open your heart and show me a little of love
Save me
You turn me into a spirit
Too many fucks we were not giving
Everyone 'round me just want me to fall
Talking to God, like "I sent a message, why won't you respond?"
It's too late for mending
I'm finna disappear with no chase
