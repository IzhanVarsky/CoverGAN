Coming over me
It's automatic
Ah-ah ah-ah
When it's you
I can feel it now
When I'm hanging out with you
I feel the same
When I'm rolling with you, still automatic
Shifts into place
It's you
Just you, and me
(When I'm here with you)
But I'm hoping it will last (oh oh oh)
This is how I feel
Don't know how it will turn out
What you do to me makes me feel alive
This feeling's automatic
And me
It feels like, it's automatic
When it's you, and me
Still automatic
Although I'm growing older
Won't tell no lie
