Get that familiar feeling of a tightness in my chest
Paint myself a future where the happiness would last
I don't know how to let you go
Over all the nights with you
I don't know if I could let you go
So sad
Can't stand the rain and I
Just can't get away from you
Wish I could fight the way I feel about you now
I'd go anywhere if it would give me peace of mind
Counting the days 'til I'm
I'm still holding on to all the baggage that you left
So sad for you
Wish I could change the way I feel about you now
Feel about you now
I travelled all this way so I could cover up the past
Some days I'm so close to moving on that I forget
Now I'm feeling sad in Scandinavia
Got me feeling sad in Scandinavia
Looking at a stranger, and I see your silhouette
Feel about you now, oh
How'd you run away from someone you can't leave behind?
