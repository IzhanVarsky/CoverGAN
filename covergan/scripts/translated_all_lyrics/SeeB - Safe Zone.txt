My safe zone
Would be no way out
'Cause you know me way too well
My own, my safe zone
I don't think that I can handle to see your face
Been taking me forever
Know my head, know my heart
And the one place you don't go
Stacking notes to myself but I know that won't help, mm, mm
Of this state of mind
I avoid goin' out on a Saturday night, mm, mm
I hide inside my walls
Is the one place you don't go
Let me hide inside my walls
To get over what we had, yeah
'Cause the bars that I like is where your friends hanging out, mm, mm
Still don't know what I'd say if I saw you today, mm, mm
Behind my skin and bones
'Cause you don't wanna see me on the other side
In the one place you don't go (Go, go, go, go)
So don't take me out
