Distance - I don't care
Now I'm up for you
I'll take your hand, squeeze it tight
You are my land
I can't stand on my feet without you, you are my universe
Decided to play with you
Palagin on the beat!
I know you're in pain
The sweetest, the most tender
Far apart again
We will run away with you
All that was, know not on purpose, but I did not want to lie to you
Understand that I need you, nee-nee-need you, love you
I saw in the eyes of this sincere fear
It's sad you don't want to understand
So tired of getting used to
You are my little, you are my little
These gossip, pride, girlfriends
Now you are mine forever
Remember, I love you, lo-lo-lo-lo-love you
You and I are one
Understand that I...
You don't know me I'm just a fool
