You're a self-fulfilling prophecy
Always comin' in last
I created the sound of madness
You've been infected by a social disease
But when you gonna wake up and fight
You think that by cryin' to me
Bringin' up the past
Wrote the book on pain
You can sleep with a gun
I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
I'm still laughin' like hell
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
Another loose cannon gone bipolar
Oh my, here we go
A kick in the ass
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
Quicksand's got no sense of humor
I think you need a shotgun blast
Somehow I'm still here
When you gonna wake up and fight
Well, then take your medicine
You think, that by cryin' to me
To explain
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
No one owes you anything
And fight
Always under attack
For yourself
But when you gonna wake up... when you gonna wake up
So paranoid, watch your back
Well I created the sound of madness
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free
Yeah, I get it you're an outcast
You've been infected, by a social disease
But I'm not, gonna part the seas
