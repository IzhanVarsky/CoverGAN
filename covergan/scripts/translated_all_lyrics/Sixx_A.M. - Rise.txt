Hey now, don't be afraid to fight for something
Rise up, it's a dawn of a new day
Look now, what have they sold you
Hands up, it's gonna be okay
Strike down all that oppose you
This is your world, just put the fear back in their eyes
Speak out, don't let the status quo define you
Rise up, it's the dawn of a new day
You can cough for their demise
Get yourself together!
Stand up and live your life
Wake up, this could be your finest hour
(Rise!)
Get yourselves together
Clear your throat now
Hands up, hands up high
Even if they anger you, get yourselves together
Even when they strangle you, get yourselves together
Pick your head up, and get your body off the floor
There comes a time when you know there's a problem
Stand up to the devil slowly rising
Stand up and live your life!
Get yourselves together!
This is your chance, and you can stand for so much more
