Every black and white
Secret's a blinking light
Can't hold on to mine
Give it away now, girl
Nothing left to lose
Nothing left to fight
She says I make it best for everyone tonight
Said she's feeling love for everyone tonight
Emma flies a kite
Twisting around my girl
Can't hold down tonight
Ooh, ooh
Although possible
Said she's feeling good, said she's feeling good
She says I make it best
Smiling beautiful
For everyone to hide
In a flash of time
Secret's seeking light
