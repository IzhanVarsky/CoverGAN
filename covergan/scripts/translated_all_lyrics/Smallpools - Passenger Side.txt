Does he keep you in the lines
And I wonder where you are now
And I know what's dead is gone
From your cracked iPhone
Losing your mind and you don't know why
So if you're alone just watching the sky
Where I would steer
I feel that you might have always been right
As we fall from each other
On quest for new lovers yeah
From the passenger side
But there's something holding on
When I think back to the ways
I miss those Vegas lights
Are you riding with your top down
I miss those desert drives
Precious cargo rides
While you switch the song
And you wanna try going for one more ride
While you slip your bra
From your ripped t shirt
Get me through state lines
Got sweat on each other yeah
Better in life than we've had this whole time
With somebody else now
Blast our favorite songs
I could steer from the passenger side
Weekend bracelets on
And we may not find partners in crime
Cause it's hot as a mother
