I’m so paranoid thanks to you
We just grew apart
Who have you been telling my secrets to
When you think of having fun
Are you doing alright tonight?
I’m afraid you’d won’t pick up so I’d just leave it how it is
So friendship was I don’t know where we are
But I could listen to you talk
It’s not the same but I don’t know what I’m asking for
Don’t think anything happened
I would call you up but I’m too anxious
It doesn’t roll off your tongue
I hope you’re doin fine
I wouldn’t know I haven’t talked to you in a while
But you don’t know my name anymore
While we went on a walk
