My head is so haunted
You can make all okay, all okay, all okay
It's a little dark sometimes
Wanna come down but I'm falling too far
I'm afraid to be honest
But I'm turning off all of these lights
Welcome to my mind
Let nobody in I'm better on my own
Where I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
Up on this cloud, up in the stars
Hearing things I think I've gone delirious
I don't know why I always act so serious
So I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
Keeping me awake every day, every day
I know I should clean it before I let you see it
Overthinking every day, every day, every day
You make me wanna change, wanna change, wanna change
So you can see what it's like
In my head I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
I live in my head I'm in here all alone
