How can I love when my heart's half gone?
Well, you had all my love in the palm of your hand
But that wasn't enough and I don't understand why
How could I be so blind? Captivated by those eyes
'Cause you stole all the love from the palm of my hand
I gave you all my time, now it's yours; isn't mine, no
Oh, my heart is half gone
I thought time and some space
And the more I got to know you, the more you would get from me
I lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight
How can I love? Yeah
(When my heart is half gone)
(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah
Might just heal all this pain
Oh, you took every piece
Lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight
But the one that I needed was you all along
And the one that I need is you all along
Yeah, you took every piece
There's not enough left for me to move on
