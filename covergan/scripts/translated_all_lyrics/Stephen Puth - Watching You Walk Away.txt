Know we said no expectations, but we got some, we got some
Are you with somebody else?
Try to play it down but it gets harder to pretend
Yeah, I wonder where you go (Wonder where you go)
I know it's getting late, yeah
Bet that you look even better in the daylight
Yeah, you leave before, I ask you to stay
You know it kills me every time
I say what's up, love?
I wake up and you're out the door
Why do we only get together after midnight?
Know we said don't want no pressure, yeah, it's alright, it's alright
Yeah, you leave before I ask you to stay
That I don't care if I see you again
So you leave before I ask you to stay
I don't know what ya do alone (Do alone)
You to stay
I don't know what ya do alone
Makin' empty conversation, it's a problem
I can feel the hesitation in between us
I see it in your eyes
One more night and it's something more
Watching you walk away
It's like we're always keeping secrets
Yeah, I wonder where you go
