Did I fuck up, did I say too much
Don’t you lay me on the table
Wake up every morning like
Don’t you lay me on the tablе
Leave me out to dry like the wind though, oh
And I’m feeling every whisper
But there ain’t no rush
On and on the feeling go
Sit here for a minute outside
Yеah I miss you
Darling did I do too much
Breathe like all the drugs that we on
Singing sentimental or worse
Cold to the touch, now it’s no more
Yeah I miss you
Darling why’d I wish too much
Don’t you wrap me around in fables
Every whisper spells out your love, oh
