In my heart, in my bones and in my soul
Indigo puff
It's in my brain
A passion moves me from within
I'm open now and feeling free
In time I, in time I, in time I...
I feel the light surrounding me
Open your mind
And drive towards the place we left behind
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Load up the guns
Running through my brain
You're the one who keeps me on my own
Now we're higher than the eastern skies
Take me where the sun shines from my mind
In my heart, in my bones, in my soul
And breathe into your hungry appetite
I see the sound land on my skin
Take it in right
