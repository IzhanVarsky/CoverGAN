We say this is crazy but have no control so we
When A first world nation
Dipped in gold, you think you hold the title of the pharaoh
We celebrate differences but look inside
They’re harassing some people, and letting some go
Jewelry stores are closing
Believe it or not all we need is a hero
Lets not resort to violence
Caligula and Nero
Has seen tomorrow
I am the same as every other guy
Tough act to follow
Smoking that shit that get you on the floor
But the pressures forming diamonds
I sip and I sip til that shit go hollow
The system is broken let’s open our mind
Brains is on the islands
And you’re sick and tired of this storm just say:
Thunderstorms and locusts
It’s a tough pill to swallow
Grab your lighters and put them up and say:
The coppers are out, man they’re back on patrol
If you’re really bout peace and love
Humans losing focus
Put our hands up, all we need is a hero
There’s no captain to steer the ship
How come nobody is smiling?
We were on the straight and narrow
Compassion levels zero
The oracle Apollo
Is the television broken
Money is power, but dasshity blind
Now it’s bow and arrows
Has an identity crisis
If you’ve really got heart and soul
The change come from within
Captive of devices
Hard to stay afloat with rising tides and rising prices
We have to come together but you’d rather be divisive
Lack of concentration
“our president don’t know shit”
