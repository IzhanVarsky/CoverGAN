My heart is locked in a maze of memories (Ah-ah-ah)
I opened my eyes that night
The growing gap between you and me
name that wanders around the mouth
My heart is locked in a maze of memories
This darkness swallowed the scream
Your hand almost caught
In the two forgotten diaries (inside, oh-oh)
In the diary of the two forgotten
This graffiti spread before my eyes
fragmented world
In the deepest place of an eternal dream
the meaning of this sad dream
never ending rhythm
please stop
Save me (Save me, oh)
tell me now
save me
Sleeping blue secret
This nightmare I have every night
Don't go breaking my heart, don't go (Breaking my heart)
go through the dream again
Don't go breaking my heart, don't go
I want to end this world
nightmare dance
the day it rained
Take me to that secret (Woah, woah)
take me to that secret
