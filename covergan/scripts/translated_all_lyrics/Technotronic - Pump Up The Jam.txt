Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
And the jam is pumping
And you'd find out if you do that
Pump up the jam Pump it
While your feet are stomping
Look at here the crowd is jumpin'
Get your booty on the floor tonight
I want
Make my day, yo
And you'll find out if you're too bad
I don't want
Make my, make my make my day
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
See, cause that's where the party's at
Pump it up Yo! Pump it!
Pump it up
Pump up the jam
A place to stay
Yo! Pump up the jam
Make my, make my day
Pump it up a little more
Yo! Pump it!
Yo! Pump it
Pump it
