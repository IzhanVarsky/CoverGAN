Friends say I gotta see reason
But I don't wanna be that son
I'm not the only one to make amends
Can't find something to believe in
But I'm crawling out of the ceiling
All that they've done wrong
If God won't forgive me
Cheats try to judge me
I'm tired of bowing to preachers all the time
Mother, it's not in my hands
But I can see the sins that stain your smile
Mother
Friends wanna kill me
Try to understand it's only 'cause I can
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Fools believe they can erase
I'm crawling out of the ceiling
But I give them all my loving anyway
I'm tired of bowing to preachers
