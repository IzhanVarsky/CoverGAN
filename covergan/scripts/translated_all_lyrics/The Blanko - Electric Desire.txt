You're my electric desire
With you I can always go higher
The light of your soul demands and the world responds
Together we're taking what's ours
Our pure domination will not be misunderstood
You're ruling the moment that everyone tries to seize
I feel you loud without a sound
We live to win, got nothing to lose
Right now, this is us, this is power
The light in the darkness, the voice from th–µ undergroung
You are my queen, the killer machine
So very strong, above and beyond
