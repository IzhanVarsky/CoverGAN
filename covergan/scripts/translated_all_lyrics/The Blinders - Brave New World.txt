My eyes in my brain
The TV culture in hyperdrive
Watch them snatch it from us all
Forgotten teachings, the son of a sin
The Kardashians on a wild acid trip
The brave new world takes its first sip
To the jungle bar, babe
From us all
It's a trip
Watch them change a dozen laws
Marching men with bewitched eyes
A light happening where it doesn't exist
Hear the sound of dystopian cries
Watch them take it from the poor
Heads now working in disguise
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world
Feet keep marching towards your demise
But did you know that it's made out of pie?
He build a wall, and he built it high
The fog moves and I'm struggling to think
Oh to be, from the land of the free
Watch them build it from the floor
The year of Ford
In come, The Idiot King
And my head's in the sink
