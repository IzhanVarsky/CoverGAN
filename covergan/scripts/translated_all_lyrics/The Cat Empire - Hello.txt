The fire brigade, or zero-zero-zero
Mm, hello, hello
Whoa, hello, hello
And I woke to discover the woman I'd been dreaming
I rolled over and I said
But most of all, welcome to the bellas in this room
In the midst of the slumber, I heard some footsteps creeping
'Cause I like to eat and laugh and fuck and play down low
Walking down the street with some evil in my eye
Come towards me, with a little cheeky smile
And some thoughts in my head that were making me feel high
Welcome to this night, welcome to this song
I was walking by my dog when I saw that sexy face
Welcome to the empire and the funky empire tunes
I was sleeping in the sand with some dreams in my head
And the waves were a-rolling like the curves on those legs
Hello, hello
Of the sweet beach bella with that centrefold spread
And some like watching people living on TV
That were causing an extension to the towel and my bed
She knelt down beside, said, "Can I share your pillow?"
Oh, hello, hello
And some like the houses with the rooftop spas
And some like to gossip about some rich sugar daddies
That's a little strange if you're asking me
Welcome to these rhymes that be going on and on
Ah, hello, hello
Pablo, Pablo
These are the things I know
But me and my friends, we like the golden brown honeys
She stopped me in my tracks and I said
On my head was a hoodie, in my ears was some bass
If she was a phone, I'd pick her up and dial
Well, hello, hello
Some like money making, some like cars
