Like cut diamond time
I'll watch the world turn
Where no light can ever return
And maybe one day we'll all stand still
Slit the moon with a knife
Step into the night
Sing Staying Alive
But baby til then
But baby til then I'll watch the world turn
All the drums in a line
You could light up the sky
Well the ghosts by my side
I didn't come here tonight
To get cornered and tired
And watch the sun fall down over that hill
We're going to run like wolves
Watch the world turn
You got a look in your eye
Like gunshots in signs
They sparkle and shine
Going to run like wolves
