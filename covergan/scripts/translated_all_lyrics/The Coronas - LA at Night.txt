Just like my card tricks
And I nearly just said something there it might be too soon
So take me to your favourite place nearby
And it's a big if
All the cynics stand up
Well I'm so glad
It's gonna be ok
You couldn't make this shit up
Ah-ah
And who wants to fall in love
Are you still mad?
Then we're both screwed just on purpose
We're careful but we're open yeah we're gonna be okay
Look at us we're nervous now but it feels kinda cool
Looks like it's one of those things that just can't be ignored
It's not a fake laugh
And we'll both lie down right here on this floor
Let's dance around that
It never seems to be enough
But I think we're almost certain yeah we're gonna be ok
And if it's too soon
Don't talk about the future or past mistakes
Keep it breezy
They're not perfect
Both careful cause we're hurting from past mistakes
Did you find it all a little too hard?
I've never seen LA before at night from this high
It's just easy
