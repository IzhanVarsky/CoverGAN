Well I don't wanna believe I don't wanna believe I would
Cause I'm screaming all these things inside my mouth
And if I could just find it
Am I freaking out?
How could I ever miss the changing of your heart
I think it's somewhere in my flaws
But I’d never deceive no I’d never deceive you love
You always liked the way I talked
Was it something that you saw
Or can I press restart?
Can I get a reaction, gimme me something I can say
Can I get a reaction, gimme something I can say
That everything we built has gone beyond repair
I wanna believe yeah I wanna believe them now
You never tried to cut me off
You don't mind it though, you just light me up
We don't have to say if we're having a good time
Cause we're losing all the things that made us good
At least we agree to disagree on that ah
Remember when you said we'd never fall apart ah
But I'd never give up no I'd never give up on us oh
That I'll never be as strong without you there
Have you had enough?
Am I just scared?
You tell me I made it, but I'm feeling kinda strange
No you wouldn't have minded
