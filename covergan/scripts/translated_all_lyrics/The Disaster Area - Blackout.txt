Crawl into my heart and they keep it cold
(To erase me)
Right to where you are
I never wanted to live forever
I never wanted to live (Live) forever
Abandoned me, left all on my own again
Well, you can fucking try
A fall from grace
You let the blackout take me
I walk with the dead but I feel the souls
Now you are the pressure holding me together
(To erase me forever)
(To erase mе)
But I blacked out all the memories
Let me take the fall for another ghost
Drive in all the nails when the coffins close
I'll always remember what you did
You have to go to erasе me
I don't care how far
You have to go to erase me
But I blacked out all my memories
