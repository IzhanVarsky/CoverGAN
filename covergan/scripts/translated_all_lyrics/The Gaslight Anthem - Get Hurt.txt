(All my friends get so low-down)
And the things once in order now seem so strange
Have you come to take her away from me?
Talking to spirits on the floor
Momma, can you say a prayer for me?
Have you come here to get her?
I keep my wounds without a bandage
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me, yeah
Baby, as I come stumblin' through the door
Once I could tell all the hurt apart from myself
Now all I can see is the need, the need
And maybe you needed a change or maybe I was in the way
(Say a prayer for me)
Might as well do your worst to me
(I think it's time to move)
And it gets pretty late and the stations will change
Sometimes I dream some more
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
I think I came to find the feeling, baby
I heard they don't get so low-down
I heard they never bleed
I think I'm gonna move to California
Not like we bleed
Maybe some things they stay and some things go away
And maybe I was mine and maybe you were not the same
Between what was mine and what was yours
And I came to get hurt
Spent my nights in dislocation
