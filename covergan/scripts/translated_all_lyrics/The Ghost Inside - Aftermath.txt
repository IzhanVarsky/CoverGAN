Today I woke up to a brand new me
(Foundations that could never break
I don't have it in me to sing of defeat
And I'm heading nowhere fast
I'll find my way after all
What happened to my happy ending?
Than I could ever say in this song
Because more was said in silence
Or is that me pretending?
Is this where it ends?
(How many times)
So how many times must I beat my head against a wall
This is where it ends
Before I finally break through?
Foundations that could never break
But the beat goes on
What happened to my happy ending?)
Running around in circles
Can I be myself ever again?
And I'm ready for what tomorrow brings
Yesterday is gone
For all the demons that follow me around
The beat goes on
It's time I put you six feet deep underground
It all played out with my life on pause
Yeah, and the beat goes on
Triumph over tragedy
So how many times
It's time to put you six feet deep underground
The sights and sounds, the rise and the fall
Was moving forward a mistake?
I will not stay silent ever again
I know I can't rewrite history
