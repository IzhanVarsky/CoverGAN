And the glamour
You've got the looks
They need - they yearn
He's a watcher
You've got supplies
If they demand it
Fall from grace
Yeah, they get by, by the grace of God
Hands shake and heads will nod
Say your prayers
A straight and narrow
Cut by the chisel
They're naive
They will act like dogs
And a voyer
They get by by the grace of god
And beat by the hammer
Hey girl
Bystander
When they recieve it
Through the darkness
Or you'll be damned
They lust with cheeks unturned
Yeah, they get by
Hey boy
You'll land it
And destroyer
You understand
We get by, we get by, by the grace of God
So they'll believe it
And the haze
