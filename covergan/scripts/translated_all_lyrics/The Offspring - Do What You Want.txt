Hey I don't know if the billions will survive
Break all the fucking rules and
I'll tear down the building just to pass through the door
Go to Hell with Superman and
Idleness and dissipation breed apathy
My moniker is man and I'm rotten to the core
Say what you must, do all you can
But I'll believe in God when one and one are five
Hey do what you want, but don't do it around me
Die like a champion, yeah hey!
A misanthropic anthropoid with nothing to
I sit on my ass all goddamn day
