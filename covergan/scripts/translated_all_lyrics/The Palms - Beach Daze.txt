If only, they told me
And it'd take you to another place
Beach daze on weekdays
Know forever there'll be
And no one's right
Well I'm just a fool
That's all I want
You make the difference
In this moment realize
But I'm only human
Baby tonight
Beach daze
To watch it wash away
Taking my own
But the voices say
Baby that's all I want
There'll be better days
And it's there for all my friends to see
When it used to come on
I just want to say
Remember how a song
Got my sleeves rolled up
You know it's just a phase
Imagine time as a currency
Floating into outer space
Build my castle back up
Now the crowds are gone
When it really shouldn't matter to me
I'm struggling to believe
Would you spend it on things that don't make you happy?
If we're gonna fall out
Now I'm turning my time into gold
Won't you come my way
Oh happiness
I'm in love with a shade of grey
