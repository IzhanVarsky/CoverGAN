I will continue to survive
Yourself
My hug will always take care of you
And even though time is running
You are the most beautiful in my life
This feeling only exists when you are with you
My hug that will always warm you
I want to know the meaning of my life
I want to be beside you all my life
And no one can take you away from me
Your tears weaken my heart
Only you complete me
I'm happy to hear your laughter light up my heart
This is my world
Myself
You are my breath
To be with you
What is there for you
Hold my hand lean on me
