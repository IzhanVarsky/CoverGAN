Said I wanna get lost in it (Lia, Lia)
Lia Lia oh Lia oh Lia
And I wonder maybe you already got a man (ooh)
Cuz I want you said I need you to understand
With each day that passes on by
So do you mind if I talk to you for a minute
Oh you're sweet so sweet, ooh yeah yeah yeah (Lia, Lia)
Ooh Lia Lia, oh Lia when I see ya
Fine for making love
Oh Lia really wanna squeeze ya
I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching
Oh I've been dreaming
I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching baby
Lia Lia oh Lia Lia
Said I just got to have it (Lia, Lia)
Summertime and the weather is fine
About you, you and I
Been a while since I felt something like this (like, like this)
I got to say I really love what you do
And this time said I sure don't wanna miss it (miss it, miss it)
Said I just wanna be your man
Come on pretty sugar take my hand
Oh Lia Lia really wanna get to know you Lia (ooh)
Little sugar givе it to me (Lia, Lia)
Said I wanna get lost in it, ooh yеah yeah (Lia, Lia)
And all the things we could be doing
