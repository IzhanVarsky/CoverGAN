Rapper of the year, fuck the nominees
Yeah, ice minus four degrees, put a ho at ease
You gotta pick up the dough
Niggas put real diamonds in fake ass Rollies, that's clown shit
They can’t understand it, this gangster shit run a panic
High beam, on the dash
Yeah, Freddie Kane clocking overseas
I ride low with the setting sun
Mr. Dayes with the break of the drums
So easily, so easily
Yeah, trap shit round you, sent your bitch on a round trip
It's icy (cold)
You can’t take it slow
I was wild, I just blessed the track, so let it breathe
I be shaking you down, it’s a wrap
This is where we go
Every whip, I wish it was either German-made or Italian
Lights out with the radio on
It's crazy
And when the Nightrider comes around
I be chasing you down, it's a wrap
Yeah, yeah, should I bless the track or let it breathe?
Them pounds in, these niggas window shoppers, they browsin’
Super dope, my geekers smoke media, Robert Townsend
Freddie Kane clocking overseas
I got a feeling that won't come down
Can't do it alone
Don't listen to what they say
I began and even when I was down and out, I was wild
Put that on VL, I put VVs in my medallion
Yeah, I need Salah, forgot to hit my knees
I'll take you to the fat of the land
Top-down with the cruise control
Harley, Corvette
I be shaking you down, it's a wrap
