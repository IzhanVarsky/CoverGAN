What kinda music
(Ooooooooo)
And I came back for more
In the corner of your eye
I'm a stranger you recognise
You go the way I go
I know that my mind will keep me down
It's too late to look back
There's nothing to see here
I didn't make a sound
I know that with time they come around
(fieuw)
The demons come and go
Hey
Forever got this tag on me
Take another look around
Can I make it clear
I was hidden amongst the crowd
Opened up a door
Your words follow me home
