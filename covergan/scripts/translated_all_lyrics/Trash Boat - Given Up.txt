I'm suffocating
Looking for help somehow somewhere
Thought I was focused but I'm scared
Put me out of my fucking misery
In my disgrace
I'm not prepared
Put me out of myâ€”
There's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me?
Stuck in my head again
I've given up
Another day's been laid to waste
Wake in a sweat again
I don't know what to take
Is there nothing you can say?
I hyperventilate
Put me out of my misery
Feels like I'll never leave this place
Take this all away
And no one cares
God!
I'm sick of feeling
