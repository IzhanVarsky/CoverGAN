We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
We're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
