I won't come back from
'Cause I could give you
(Look over my shoulder)
But is it worth it for you?
'Cause I know that I never did trust you
All I need is a little more from you
Every day
I just need your trust to get me through, yeah
’Cause you know I can't always be my best
Just what I want girl really ain't worth debating
Already had enough of you
And that’s why your love
But you ain't done enough for me, my love
There's why you look
She digging hole so I could fall in
Anything you want
It’s unlike you, my love
On my shoulder
It's unlike you, my love
And that's why I got no weight on my shoulder
Over my shoulder
It's unlike you
She coming at me like the stonemen
Is away
I never meant to put you to this test, oh yeah
There’s why you look
Leave you colder
Looking anymore
And that's why your love
