I've been waitin' for it so long, so long
Oh, I love and care for a lot of you
Somethin' to show me where the hope is
How long? I keep waitin' for you
You keep on sayin' that you love me
You don't like to share, I do
So gone, yeah
No? That's okay, that's cool
Hold on, yeah
I love you, baby, but I'm so gone, so gone
But for how long? Yeah
Oh, I love and care for more than one of you
Can't you see the way I do?
For how long?
You're sayin' that you love me? Yeah
Tell me, how long?
So long, yeah
I keep waiting on a moment
You keep tellin' me to hold on, hold on
