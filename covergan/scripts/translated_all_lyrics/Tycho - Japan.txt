I'll be so good to you
On your own when you landed
Oh, I’m on a roll
To tell you the truth
I'm bad, but I'm good
I’m gonna break her down
For me to come home
You got me spinning round for you
So you can't say I didn’t warn you
This a touch and go
I don't know how it happened
She don’t mind at all
At all
I won’t make
Don't know how it happened
She don’t mind
Hey, yeah
Came home from Japan
But don’t wait
Steady as she goes
She don't mind
