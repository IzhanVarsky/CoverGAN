Oh, baby, breathe now
Yeah, hey, yeah
Get yourself off the ground
Roll down the window
Dangerous, I like to keep it a little bit dangerous
Come down now, come down now
I'm serious, I like to keep it a little less serious
Come down now, come down now, yeah
Am I too good for love?
Yeah, we could skate all day and all night long
No, I won't save you but I'll show you how
Oh, we're flyin' now, not gonna let you down
Hey, yeah
Don't complicate it, complicate it
Come down now
Not gonna let you down
Won't be too good for love
Oh, feel the breeze now
No conversation, no conversation
