I'll change my name to Swift
Your long blonde hair girl heaven flow
Baby, just say yes
I say 'hi, my name is Tyler, nice to meet you, how's your day been goin'?
And 'hi' my name is Taylor, nice to meet you, how's your night been goin'?
'Cause that's when I think happiness
Talking 'bout why you had to let him go
Would you mind if I stopped in and told you 'hi'?
So I roll the dice, no more time I'm wastin'
Am I mistaken?
Noticed she was poppin' to a T-Pain beat
The girl who wrote "Fifteen"
You belong with me
And yes I could see ya in my future
I meet you at the Denver show
The way you wear that little black dress
She wore a little black dress in the middle of spring
Like the firework flash on the fourth of July
Or the sunset fallin' from the summer sky
Then I fell right back down to my reality
Could this really be?
So I stroll on by like the summer breeze
The prettiest scene is you just marryin' me
Last night's dream that's how it went
I'll even promise you this
That pretty long blonde hair girl gone and caught my eye
I saw you in a video
My hands are shakin'
Just Taylor and Tyler Swift
And I, I can see her in my future, writing songs together
I'm sitting outside on the front porch swing
I finally get to meet
And I was noddin' my head right there sayin' this ain't fair
I even promise you this
Just for that one shot at a meet and greet
'Cause I first saw you in a video
Call me Tyler Swift
For thirteen minutes I was heaven sent
I'll be right there backstage if you need anything
I won a contest at the radio station
