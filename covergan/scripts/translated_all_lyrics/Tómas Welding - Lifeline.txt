Why are we drifting apart?
Too late to find a way home?
I'm paralysed
Throw me a lifeline
Waiting for you to come and knock on my door
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper
I'm missing your touch
(Deeper, deeper)
Trying to escape the thoughts in my head
You pull me in so you can shut me out
Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
Deeper, deeper, comfort the ground
Is it too late for love?
I can't live without your love
Lying in bed
Again and again and again
Too late for apologies?
Too late to fund a way home?
Broken bottles on the bedroom floor
This is too much
Sleepless nights, no love, no more
Deeper, deeper, it's pulling us down
Woah Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
