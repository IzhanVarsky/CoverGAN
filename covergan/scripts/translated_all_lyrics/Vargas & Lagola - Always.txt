I have to think twice right before I speak, yeah
How many ways can you say it so?
Just know I will be loving you always, always
Oh, forget about everything you heard
Always and forever grateful (Always and forever grateful)
Oh, so overwhelming
I cannot lie when I look into your eyes, your eyes
Always and forever grateful
Oh, I need you now more than you know
How many times do I need to say that?
The house has always been here
Something about you seems so magical
So plant the seed and let it grow, always
All these questions never ending
When I don't run from anybody else? Why?
Why do I keep going if I'm absent
How many days do you need to sober up? Yeah
