I've been too stupid to let you know that
It doesn't matter who is wrong or right
You don't have to justify your sins
Hey, I've been too proud to let it go (What'd you say?)
Am I too emotional, irresponsible to be carefree? Ooh
I can feel the thunder and the lightning from within me
Don't care if they never notice
Take a little something for your heartache, for the better
We don't need to leave now, we can stay here forever
I feel we've been here before, yeah
We sink and we swim, we lose and we win
But go ahead and call me selfish, but I didn't give you up
Maybe it's a no return, but you're always on my mind
Yeah, you got soaked, intentions are good
Go ahead and call me selfish for holding onto my love
'Cause I'm not afraid anymore
I didn't believe in magic before you
Hey, I've been too proud to let it go
