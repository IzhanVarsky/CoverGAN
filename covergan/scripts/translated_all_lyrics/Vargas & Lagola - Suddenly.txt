Suddenly I feel weightless now
Up and down and round and round a roller coaster
Wonder why we never stop, we're always searching
Smiling when you're telling me it's always worth it, worth it
Suddenly I feel painless now
Listen to our records singing picture perfect
'Cause I know the sound of a heart when it's breaking, breaking
Oh dear mama, little did I know
Suddenly I feel chainless
Babe, I know the signs of freedom when I see 'em, see 'em
But I never found a reason to be waiting
Easy to be wise after a good night's sleeping
Suddenly
I do my best to try to use a little patience
Babe, you say the world is heavy on your shoulders, shoulders
Never leave your side until the war is over
Using all your powers never count as cheating
Suddenly I feel changes now
