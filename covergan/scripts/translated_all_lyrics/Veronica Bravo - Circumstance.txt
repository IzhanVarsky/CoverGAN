If it’s not today
It’s getting old yeah
We just talked it out
Things been out of place
But I won’t leave
It’s everybody else
When will it be?
Are you here to stay?
Don’t worry I won’t leave now
We’ve ironed all the kinks out
And now we’re gold
And we’ve been losing sleep
I love ya, I love ya
Don’t worry, don’t worry
Some just always get their way
You’re flying like kings now
We should go to bed now
Cause they all got their heads down
To let it go
Can’t hear us though
We been holding out for days
We’ll focus on the good somehow
Even weeks
Not our fault
I’ll paint over that frown
It’s all good, it’s all good
Don’t worry
Don’t say you’re sorry no
Permanently
And try and get some sleep
Am I misconceived?
It’s just the circumstance
Don’t worry it’s all good now
So we can move on
All we need is space
Baby I understand
I believe
Up in the clouds
We got too much going on
Everyone’s too loud
