'Kay, well everything's a part of me
Why'd you look away?
Shouldn’t spend no time guessing what you’re gonna say
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
It's tough out in the cold
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Heart pumping, still don’t wanna pass away
And they send it to my home
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Want me to sweep you off your feet
And this love is just a loan
Got used to dealing with your pretty little lies
I'm just screaming like-
Hope they don't make me a clone
These thoughts still moshing
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Same words, different tone
Yeah, oh, yeah
I wanna charge, they watch for free
I order on my phone
I kick it all alone
But I can’t stand living like this up in any way
What you want then?
The internet is fucking me
The pop culture, the jewelry
And I felt it better than I ever did in my life (On that night)
I'm feeling super great
Its not my problem
Wha-What was it something that I said?
And I never used ya, didn't see a warning sign
I'm just screamin' like
Just cool it, only got a matter of time
Don't need no apology
Nothing on its own
Will do it, well, probably
And I cannot feel my face
Weekdays I just let em run away
'Member what it did for me
