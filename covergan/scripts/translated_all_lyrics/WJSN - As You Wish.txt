all your wishes come true
Now only good things like this
throw you into another world
Feel me, we want, we want, love ya
as you wish
achieve bomb la-ta la-ta
I will always go see you oh
As you wish
Tell me, tell me everything, your heart
everything will come true
Everything you wanted
I'll listen to everything whenever, whatever
In the dark night I'll find the light
I will smoke you
never come again
as the feeling comes
Light footsteps fly with the wind
On this beautiful night that counts the stars
Promise me, this moment is forever, just like this
Come on, our own world (I will make it)
shine on you in the dark
A day with a good feeling for some reason (It’s sweet, it’s a different feeling)
I will do it I will do it
I'll show you everything whenever, whatever
I will only be by your side like this
I will do it I will do it (oh oh oh oh)
Hold my hand without being shaken by the harsh wind
to another world
tell me what you want
Don't hesitate any longer, never
I will close my eyes and show you (I will make it happen)
Little by little it gets dyed and overflows
Yul-i-la-yuri-la-yuri-ya
I will do it I will do it (oh, oh!)
Trust me, fly over that sky
Now just stay by my side
call my name alright
We will always be together oh
show me your heart
look at me like now
as I dreamed
tell me i'll listen
My heart is full of excitement in this moment
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
May we never change
made obliviate
take me out
Shine a light towards you like this
in my heart
