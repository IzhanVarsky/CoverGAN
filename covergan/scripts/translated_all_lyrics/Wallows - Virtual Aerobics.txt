Hey there, safe travels
I’ll clean 'em off when they get a scuff
I'll get to your side like that
Simple words that might
Yeah, you made me blush like that (Like that)
Only been here one night, leavin' doesn't feel right
Hey, watch my grapevine and my sidekick
I'll clean ’em off when they get a scuff
We could live a life like that (Like that)
Kill me, let's spend the night
I'll probably overwear these Nikes
Read it, I unravel
Work hard no matter what happens next
It lets me see it totally new
I love how you kiss like
I love how you move like that
Being here for the first time with you
I’m not too good, but I try my best
When we aren't together, fuck all of the weather
There's no color in San Francisco
Doing some virtual aerobics
You laughed and said, "Just look around you"
Side like that, side like, side like
Let’s spend the night
Yeah, you called me out like that (Like that)
Tell me when you think they've had enough
Wanna dress in what makes you like me
