Gave me the song
Duld and dwelling lands
Give me vision
In all my time?
As you tempt
White frame
Let's fly
Gygrefuggel
In wide winds
Gave me wings
Let me divorce
Gave me sion
Lend me a feather
Teach me the song
Do you want to protect me?
Magic crow
Entices me
White raven
Wings white
With the song seida
Out in the foam
I hear you ask!
Look in the shade
Do you want to follow me?
(Which tempts me)
White wings
Then I will ache
As you find
Follow me
(As I find)
I hugjen veida
