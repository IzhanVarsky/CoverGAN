They testify of nid
It does not leave
Towards the sun we stretched
In the bark its wound
Right!
Day cracking
Far down in the mess
For every single sprout
Some sting more than others
Heavily it weighs
Odal
Goodbye old
Give root you direction
Hugs at all
We are an old tree
When storms go
Look deep into me
Host me higher and deeper
I'll give you your share
The night it comes
Deep in the ground
They testify of honor
you have to understand
With newly sprouted buds
Kvedar
eyes blue
than you can bear to pray
entrance abandoned
Hugs, take no more
If you want
Forward to grow
and in rings of years
