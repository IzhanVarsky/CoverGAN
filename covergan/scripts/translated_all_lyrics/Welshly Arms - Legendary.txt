Tell them the truth, but they think it's just made up
Got to leave it all on the floor
It's about to be legendary
Let everybody hear your battle cry
Take a look around me
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Ooh)
We could never turn back now
And on, and on, and on
To make a stand, you've got to win the fight
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson (Ooh)
Gonna get their attention (Attention)
You gotta live without a compromise
'Cause we're gonna be legends (Legends)
I think they got it all wrong
Gonna get their attention (Ooh)
We just gotta hold on
Ever since we were seventeen
(Legends) Oh, oh
Been looking for the answers
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Legends)
Through the struggles and the trade-offs
A new answer to the same question
'Cause we're gonna be legends (Ooh)
You know the truth can be a weapon
Can't stand the heat, then just stay out the light
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson (Lesson)
How many times will you learn the same lesson?
Yeah
Eventually, they're gonna know who's right
To fight this world of ill intentions
What we're doing here ain't just scary
Taking pages from a magazine
And I think they got it all wrong
For you might never make it out alive
Fighting tooth and nail on the way up
(Legends) Ooh, legends
Been dreaming of the payoff
And we couldn't want it anymore
This is what we came for
