Don't be discouraged
Like a rainbow
Don't be, don't be afraid
You can lose sight of it all
Oh, I realize. it's hard to take courage
You call me up, 'cause you know i'll be there
Show me a smile and don't be unhappy
But I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
In a world, full of people
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
And the darkness inside you can make you feel so small
And You've taken all you can back
You with the sad eyes
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
Your true colors, true colors, true colors are beautiful
