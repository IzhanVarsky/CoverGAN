But we all need somebody to love
I know you getting tired of Versace and the loafers
But he fucked up and now you're numb
Yeah the taste of love but he fucked up and now you're numb
You got every pair but need somebody that could hold ya
Treat you like my music
Livin' pages of the past movin' forward different story, yah-yah
Girl you got my heart and can't nobody take it from you
You said you're over and done
Take you everywhere you want to go and not your money
I love you with a passion, yeah
'Cause you had a hole in your heart that the bags can't fill
If you don't like you a secret I keep you so undercover tho
You had a taste of love
Over and done with love
Need your lovin', I put no one up above ya
Got me so distracted, yeah-yeah
No one knows about you don't mean that I don't trust you
Different chapter, yeah
Twitching on my faction, yeah
We all need somebody
I'm infatuated, yeah
Pain in your eyes that the cash can't heal
Girl, I'm locked in, don't know why you asking now
You probably really don't need my help
I know that you can do it all by yourself
Wake up every day waiting for it to be over
