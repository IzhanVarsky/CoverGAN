If you look back, you can't count
By itself
I'm on
So now
Memories come back
Found me
Come up
With happiness
In uneasy days alone
Ale to send
With my joy
I remember
The day I met
Your smile you will never forget
Nevertheless
Already beside you
Your tears overflowing
A lot of love is overflowing
Your joy
You took me out
In everyday life, not just fun
Your importance is happiness
Even in a remote city
If you look back, there are many
Where no one can see
You see, I'm so happy
forever and ever
We are working hard
visited
The spring of joy
Rescue me
See the tears shed
Being by your side
Kiseki who always walked with you
I'm happy
Such a thing that can be shared
I'm connected to you now
Living gap
Dandruff prayer
Every day
That's how I grow up
May I be with you forever
Memories overflow
I can't go back to anyone
With a smile like that day
Walk forward
To you who look lonely
Please don't cry
My feelings are just
I love you
Hard things
Hey you
Departure season
Thank you
It leads to a lot of love
