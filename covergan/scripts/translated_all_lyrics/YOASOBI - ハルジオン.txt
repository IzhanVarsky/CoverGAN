Two people reflected on the screen looking melancholy
Bloomed beyond the border
The future also slipped through the gaps between my fingers
I locked the door of my worn-out heart
I told you I like you
Your sign
Only I was left
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Remember you
Still I just want to see you again
Unknowingly
There is just no beauty
To know too much that you don't want to know
What was projected is the future trapped in the buds
The feelings she hid with this hand without showing it to anyone
Was laughing
Ah-ah
Time passes to leave alone
With your words and beautiful time of that day
I'm still alive in me If you close your eyes
I'm going back to the scenery of that day
The back of my eyes was soaked in the sky that was too blue
I drew the border myself
To the future that has certainly begun to move
I should have been able to see
The feeling that the scenery we spent together was forgotten
I'm walking through the continuation of the days I can't go back
The scenery that revives vividly and the fragments of everyday life that cannot be returned
Still reaching for the two of that day
From now on, even without you
With daily fragments that cannot be returned
I nodded and believed in your words
I can't see it, I can't see it
Connecting the future that should have been lost
I was swallowed by the days that just passed
If you wave to the two of you that day
Even though I could actually see the bright flowers
I'm still looking for it
I was pretending not to see the reality
In the passing time
