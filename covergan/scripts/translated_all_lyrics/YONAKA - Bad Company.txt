(Got bad company)
I've been lying in my bed, but I haven't slept a wink
But I won't react 'cause I'll look psycho
This can't keep going on
And you talk to me with your violent tongue
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
So tell me what you want, tell me want you want
Now it's my blood you see
So tell me what you want, tell me what you want
When I try to close my eyes, yeah, my mind, it just overthinks
I was left with no choice but to care about company
Yeah, I know I'm not alone
So I guess I got bad company?
Oh, what does he want from me?
But I know I'm not alone
No, this can't keep going on
Mother, can you help me?
'Cause I was fine before you came to my door
So I guess I got bad company
'Cause I know that it's not, I know that it's not
Why have you come for me? (Why have you come for me?)
Is this just fun for you? (Is this just fun for you?)
I go out of my mind, thinking 'bout what I used to be
I got a picture in my head, but it's not what I like to see
Why do I feel like I'm suffocating?
No sound comes out, no one's to be seen
And then this big black cloud came down to smother me
Said, "I don't know," but he won't leave
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
'Cause I'm trying to scream, it feels like a dream
I've been locked up, can't escape it
Because I am you
