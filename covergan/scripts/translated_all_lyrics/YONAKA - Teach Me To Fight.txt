Can't you see you're on your own?
So you turn up at my door
Walk into the room, everybody looks the same
Put down your small-talk and teach me to fight
Caught in the mirror, can't recognise your face
Take a trip and you might find...
I'm feeling pretty empty, this attitudes expensive
Bet you're itching to find out
Why you scared of change, yeah?
Working on their bitch face
Oooh, oooh
Trying too hard, yeah it's gonna make you age
Get out my way, I'm sick of being polite
And the party's over now
Waiting on the next fad on the next trend
But you don't know anyone
Doesn't like the way that this curse leaves my lips
Tryna' act a grownup, now that's pretty funny
I'm so tired of this place, yeah
Let's make this personal, stop wasting my time
I thought I'd have it worked out and I'd be making plenty
Posers in the hall and they clogging up the stairways
Fuck what you think, I'm not trying to impress you
Come on baby, let's play!
Small town baby, got his knickers in a twist
And it's all I seem to see
I'll probably just upset you, you're tryna' be your best you
Too many photos and not enough friends
And it's all you seem to know
Where the party's gonna go
Suited and booted, but got no money
Oooh, ooh oooh
Let's make this public, let's take it outside
