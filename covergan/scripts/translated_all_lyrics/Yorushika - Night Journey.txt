Smooth, smooth
You will forget, but only the memories are true
I don't need anything else
Natsuhara, who stands up, with his hair still, crying and raining evening, evening, evening
I'll stay here
I don't need any words
Hey, what will happen to us when we grow up someday?
Hey, what would happen to us if the night came like this?
I see
I'm going over there all the time
Flower breeze, swaying and single-flowered grass
Yeah, I'm an adult
Is there anything you want to do? I wonder if i want to see it
Well, if it's a neighboring town, I'll get there
Haruru Hara-kun's song and one-wheeled grass
Rippling Natsuhara, crying without tears, Higurashi is evening, evening, evening
You don't know yet, but the sky is also made of words
Lyrics of Yorushika "Night Journey"
Harara, Harara, Harari
Summer is over
Well, I'll get there at the end of the road
Do you want to take the train? I wonder where I am
