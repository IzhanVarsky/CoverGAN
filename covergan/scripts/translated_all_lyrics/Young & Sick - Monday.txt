It's been a while since I felt this naked
There's always something to live and die for
Aah, aah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And it'll be another ten to love myself, oo!
And I know I should look after my mental health
It took me thirty-two years to believe in me
And the only thing blue are the dreamy skies of New York
In love with you
But there's comfort in knowing I'm not alone
My head may hurt, but my heart doesn't ache for once
But for now, it's Monday and I'm in love, oo!
I wish I liked myself better naked
Ooh
It's Monday and I'm in love
Ooh, ooh
