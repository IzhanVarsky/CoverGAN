The mornings are getting harder
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
I hear you loud and clear, it's alright
I won't panic, won't break down (my love)
I'm showing wear and tear, oh
No static, all love
Asking when are you gonna save me (my love)
And now I'm getting sick and tired
(My love)
And like wine, they stain the floor
The stories are getting old
I caught my reflection in the water
Looking in the mirror
No static, all love (my love)
(The early hours ain't pretty. What about doing music full of regalia ready the world , at least my home? Generally happy, and you're partly to blame. I hear you loud and clear. All love, no static.)
No panic, I, I
No static, I, I
Of getting sick and tired again
But I've been getting on myself quite well
No static, all love (my love, oh)
I'm getting fed up with being fed up, oh no
I can do it without (my love)
And my nights, they aren't so pure no more
I'll take control, I swear (my love)
