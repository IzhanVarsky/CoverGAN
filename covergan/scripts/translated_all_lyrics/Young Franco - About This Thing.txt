Came with the boom box on the rooftop
King for the good vibe like Luda
Can't have one if you ain't lost none
Cause it's bombai when the baseline drops
Still hot steppin' in my air max ones
Baseline bangs from here to Newcross
Sky walking kinda like Lucas
Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
I ain't gonna lie and I ain't gotta front
Can't have none if you ain't lost one
Rude boy really better make that chit chat stop (Whoop)
I just come here to (smash) someone
Big big poppa bear call me the dun
Now its time for somethin' you love
Little rascal like dizzy in the ends
New drops got the crew hot on the new block
(Whoop, whoop, whoop)
Yeah, (whoop whoop whoop)
When I come through I make the bass go (whoop)
Who's hot who's not
This one free nizzle in the sound system
What you know about this ting
Hey send a friend to a friend
Yeah, what you know about this ting
Here I come here I come
I just come here to show some love
Tell it from the start I'ma tell it from the jump
Step out, you know I be the creme de la creme
Flip modes switch flows where'd you get that from
Hold up
Call me king kinda like Luther
Here I come, here I come
(And it goes like)
Call for the ting I got
Here I (huh)
Yeah, so what you know about this ting
Yeah, what you know about this ting, what you know about this ting
FWW yeah they call me the dun
Busy with the flow and I be busy with the pen
Pull up in the club came in the uber
