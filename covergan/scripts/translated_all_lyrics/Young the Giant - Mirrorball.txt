I know I have made mistakes
Spinning out of control
Everybody has reason to fall
Am I a ghost?
Cuz I told ya!
The world is round
Hiding in the dark
Go on, tear me apart
It's over now
Give me something to hold
(we are the ghost)
Look into the glass
The world is small
I finally figured out
You're all I see
And I told ya, I told ya I know...
Living in the past
Through my mirrorball
Opposite attraction
Told ya I know
And heavy in my mouth
Looking for some action...
The wait is over now
Time is lost
Mirror ball
Can't fall asleep
