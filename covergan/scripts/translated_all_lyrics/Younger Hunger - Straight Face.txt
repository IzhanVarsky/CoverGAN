You know I'm falling fast
I've got no money and I'm dead inside
You're sweet like a lemonade
I don't wanna waste your time
Falling your way
Plus I got problems that are hard to hide (to hide)
I don't smile enough (enough)
I wanna kiss your neck
(I don't smile enough) (enough)
You're the kind that I always crave
But the second you show up
You know that I can't keep a straight face
(But the second you show up)
Medicine for a foggy day
Just one taste is enough
I wanna hold you on a cold day
Just one taste and I'm far away (away)
So mosey your way down to Norma's Double R Diner, where the juice is cold, but the coffee's always hot
I can't keep a straight face
And touch your face
I'm addicted to your face
