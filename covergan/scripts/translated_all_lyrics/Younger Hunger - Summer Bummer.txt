Over and over again
How could I be ?
Tomorrow the world will be
Just things I do not deserve
Safe from me
And all my furniture
So many things left to do
Without you babe
No one
I think I need a minute
(Summer)
But these days
I gotta breathe a second
Before I break my limit
(Bummer)
Thoughts getting darker
I could work harder
Everything's a bummer
Is really a friend
I can't run away
Wake up in summer
I burn my calendar
