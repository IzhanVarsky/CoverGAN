What makes me different to you?
Let me assure you, I'm serious
Just seems a little ridiculous
Oh, I fail to see these so called changes
Can you explain it?
It's time to change your views
So let me know if you're hearing this
I got nothing to lose
Don't blame it on your design
No need to patronize
And I'm over it
We just go in circles
Haven't you heard the news?
Not gonna listen when you pretend to compromise
We're all apart of the fight
Don't say you're mislead
You knew it, you messed up
(And don't say that "we gotta get over it")
Don't cut me off, don't call me "Miss"
When the way you act ain't right
Oh, give me faith in how you're changing
What's inside your head?
And everything to prove
Yeah, frankly, I'm just sick of it
You need to stop and just let it go
Don't think you should get used to this
The way you act ain't right
