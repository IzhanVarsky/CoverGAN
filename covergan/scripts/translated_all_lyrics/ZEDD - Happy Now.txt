You're the only one who can
And only you know the strength of your teeth
Are you happy now?
World away
But don't you dare ask me how I've been
Now only you know the strength of your teeth
In a foreign place
You're a world away
You're the only one who can up and run
Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain
You keep on talking sweet till your fingers bleed
Spin me around in circles till I'm wrapped in string
And lonely
Somewhere in the crowd
Leave me just as empty as the day you came
There's nothing left to say
You're the only, you're the only
So won't you tell me, babe
The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
So I shut my mouth
And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
In the palm of your hands you can make me dance
