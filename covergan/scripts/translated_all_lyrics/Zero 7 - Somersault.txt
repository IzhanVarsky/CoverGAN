You feel like home, you feel like home
You're obsessed with hiding the sticks and stones
You put my feet back on the ground
You give love to all and give love to me
You feed other people's parking meters
You're the warmth in my summer breeze
You encourage the eating of ice cream
When I fear the unknown
You were sweet and you were sound
You're the ivory to my ebony keys
You would share your last jelly bean
You saved me
You would somersault in sand with me
You're the prince to my ballerina
You talk to loners, you ask how's your week
Did you know you brought me around
