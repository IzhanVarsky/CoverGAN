And the worst thing is that I never want to see you
You under the tablecloth
and you already forgot me
you stuck to the wall
You, in every corner, you
you already forgot me, oh
You, crying on the platform
you already have another
You in the blue dress
And you already have another
I'm sinking into the habit of loving you
You already forgot me
You, who orbit me like the Sun
You, who live in my mind, you
you already forgot me, uh
your look in the rear view mirror
you have another
I'm falling apart from your absence
You, what a way to hold on, you
