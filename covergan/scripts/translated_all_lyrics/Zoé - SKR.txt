It was always you
With your colored smiles, I painted melodies in the air
Tranquility, vulnerability
Oh my sunshine, I won't give up
It is not vanity of spirit
I erased my personal history with a dimensional fan
Beautiful woman, morning star
Oh my sun, I feel like dying
All that I was stays here
So far from me, nothing is forever
I dug furiously into the pillow, looking for traces of a beautiful childhood, uuh
I miss you
But I'm a complete idiot
I always tried to give you the best
A magical glow rests on my dunghill of the eardrum
Oh, my sun, and I'm not going to give up
Love horror, human error to have fallen into temptation
What loneliness, damn anxiety
Songs of love, of compassion
It will be the path that leads me to you
I have to fight for the hope of love
Bizarre misanthrope, rhetoric of fragile youth
Horror love, deep mistake to have fallen prey to fear
And I restarted my heart to see if I could love myself again
It will be the dark night of the soul
Flashes of light, hellish sadness
A fragrance of pain made me touch that which was immutable, uuh
With the membranes of your smell I built myself castles of revenge
The light of my being, morning star
