Do you really wanna fall apart?
Who knew you would seal my fate?
You said you’d never try to leave my side
Time flies by when you're in the dark
I can face the demons on my own
I’m made of stardust, I'm blowing away
But all you ever told my slice
But all you ever told was lies
I feel like I am falling in reverse
