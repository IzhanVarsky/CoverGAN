Si pue', Brayan está bien cansado
(It's getting late) But I'm not nearly done
(I miss my bed) Let's hang out, come on
Ah, tranqui, quédate
You can't possibly be meaning the words that come out of your mouth
¿En serio? Pero la estaba pasando bien po, quédense un poco más po hueón
I'm sleepy too, I promise this will be worth it
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
(Are you really sure you don't wanna come with us?)
Just 'cause you want to, I don't think that it's fair
¡Oye, Wachito!
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
There's way too many reasons to stay here
The truth is that I don't wanna stay without you
Are you leaving now?
¿Qué?
Yapo
And if we go, we'll miss it all
What do you mean?
¿Se van ahora, al tiro?
I was shy at first, but they welcomed me
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna
I'm putting my foot down, I'm staying here
Yeah
You say that you're tired and want me to calm down
No me quiero ir
Dime
You wanna go home, but I just wanna have fun
Nos tenemo' que ir
Are you serious?
