Someone you know from recollection
I can't deal with no emotion
Lost in her dose but I'm getting out tonight
Don't say it anymore, yeah
It's not a dream not a delusion
And now I guess I'm going solo
No echoes in the hall
Can't hear them anymore no
You can keep all your commotion
Been wasting all that to devotion oh
I been around yeah did I mention?
I can't even tell she's gone
Knife cold, she knows, I can tell she's kryptonite
There is no us that is a no go
Is this a dream or just delusion, shit
I'm cashing short of all the notions
The writings on the walls
