What’s not me what I could be
Like I should keep on listening
I can’t make magic
But I'm benevolent
A compromise yeah I know it's true
To the streets turn out the heat
With right and wrong we'll find our fixes oh
Late nights have got me feeling
I can't live without her
Can’t say its over
Gotta find a way to make it work without
So let us all fall into consensus
Real talk, no gimmicks
Yeah she's a witch
Lover and I
I know we got together and forever but
Walked to your doorstep thinking
I mean we can pretend
Taken for granted
I can't make magic
Feels right now in it
Feel like nothings better
Remember how we used to
Keep talking to myself lately
Just so you know
You know I can't stop thinking
About how you keep on missing
Can't say its over
Hands around your waist
All the ones know I can’t do
Eyes closed for a minute
