Falling into each other
With a heart made out of stone
You was reckless when we met and I fucked with it
They say don't go she tore my heart into two
And place on your bedside when I stray
I ain't been sober since last month
Lost in a feel when I sent it
I been so caught up how can I stay
Got me so turnt up
Retrace my steps and you done did it
I was pulled right under
Might as well start how you ended
Nothing like saying I lover her
Wavy feeling so wavy
Gave back just so you know
All these red roses that I slay
I ain't wanna believe a damn thing about you
Heartbeat felt like thunder
Would you even notice if I fade
Hey dear tell me are you cold
Thinking about your lips on my face
I don't wanna know a thing about you
Mmh mmmh
Ey ey
Shorty you done wasted my time
We were falling under
If I fade
Oh I been up so late baby so late
Fuck
Wish I never made you mine oh
