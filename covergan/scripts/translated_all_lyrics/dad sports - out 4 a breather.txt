I think you're kinda cool
Someday I'll have you wonder
Caught by her gaze, not turning away
Maybe after school
Do you wanna hang
Follow the feeling, say what you're meaning
What we would look like face to the stars
Out for a breather, sit in the dark
She'll never like me that way
Wondering what she's thinking
Never complacent, always redundant
Carrie said that we don't have the time
Said you didn't have a choice
Maybe she likes me that way
Maybe I'll have you over
Held on the stakes I'm slipping away
To ever make it matter
Blushing away, so caught in your eyes
Brushing the wind, so caught in the ties
Doesn't it seem like so much to think
Do you know my name
Aren't you tired of my voice
