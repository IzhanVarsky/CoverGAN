All my life (take me for a ride)
I can finally breathe under water
Well beyond the night, and past the sun
And everything ends inside
I have learnt to sleep on the clouds
And I've become lost in time
All my life (infinite beside)
'Cause I've been lost
It's far beyond open skies
'Cause I've been lost all my life
Take me for a ride
Infinite beside
As if I'm lost, I'll be fine
On the other side I'll be singing
