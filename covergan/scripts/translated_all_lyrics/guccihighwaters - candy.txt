Couldn't give a fuck if I lose this
Take a trip to Paris, make her feel careless
You can be my girl but we ain't getting married
In the air, it makes me sick, and I can taste it now
I can't sleep, I just weep, drown in whiskey that ain't cheap
Love is just a sweet mistake we make, could give you all
Lips taste sweet like candy
But I've been reflecting, I'm losing the best thing
Every time we speak, you speak in tongues, I run in place
Trust me, don't wanna forget you, no
I might have to block you, know it's for the better
Why I'm fucking with you, bitch?
Off these pills, off these drugs, so much stress, when's enough
For the better, for the better
So why do I do it? Emotionally clueless
Left your lipstick stain on my sweater
Playboy bunny ice her out with karats
When I'm gone, will you miss me? Gone, will you miss me?
She said I'm a savage, so I let her have it
All this time that I've wasted how?
And I don't really know nothing better
Out of bounds I've been drifting, bounds I've been drifting
Hold my breath, need some peace, need some love
This ain't new, I been through this
Close my eyes, I see your face
Feeling so stupid
But how much will it take? Oh, how much will it take?
This love won't last never ever
Feeling so foolish
Regret it all when I do it
I been glued to my bed, too much shit inside my head
