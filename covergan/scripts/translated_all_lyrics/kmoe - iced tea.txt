When I see your face I'm really thinking that you might be
Oh, so you said hadn't thought of that
Be mine, for the rest of the time
Hey, forgot that's when it started, back when it started
(Back when it started, back when it started, back then)
(Back when it started, back then)
Gotta call you back
Hey, one sec, I gotta call you back, gotta call you back
Hey, one sec, I gotta call you back
(At my heart like that, had my heart like that, yeah)
I've got nowhere else to be now
But then you texted me
Hey, forgot that's when it started
But you're ignoring me
Mine, for the rest of the time
(I said I could be your sugar honey iced tea)
I'm bored and I'm weak
(Hey)
(Hadn't thought of that, I hadn't thought of that, yeah)
I said I could be your sugar honey iced tea
(Gotta call you back, gotta call you back)
Woke up by the sound of myself snoring (Snoring, snoring)
Took the bus home 'cause it was pouring
(When I see your face I'm really thinking that you might)
Hey, pulling at my heart like that
Texted you all night until the morning
I got nothing to hide, I got nothing to hide
