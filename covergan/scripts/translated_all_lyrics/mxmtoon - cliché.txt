You said “Yeah I do
But I wouldn’t have it any other way (Any other way)
Oh, no one could compete (No one could compete)
But that’s okay!
A silly cliché
Mmmh, woah
Swept me off my feet
Bah duh duh dum
It was too late for me (Too late for her)
Bah duh duh duh duh dum
And I felt dead
And looked right back
You took a step forward and tilted your head
You looked me in the eye
That’s okay
I walked into the room and then I saw your face
You said “Better now”, with a smile
A little cliché
I looked down at the ground
What’s your name? I’d really like to know about you"
You said “Hey”
I said “Hello
I wanted to be with you (And only with you)
We’re just a little cliché
I looked up at your face
I said, “Hello, I gotta know, do you feel this way?”
You made me laugh, you made me blush
It wasn’t made to work
And I said “Hello
And that’s what we were
With a curious glance, you stared
And those eyes, they drew me in
Over the next few days, we got to talking
With every single word I started falling farther
Or the clacking of tap shoes
It was too late for me
I didn’t wanna fall but then I stepped right in
Oh, what a cliché, but it, to be honest, it made my day
I didn’t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in
Erase myself
And then I wanted to erase myself
You were so witty and so charming
And that’s all we were
It felt like just one big whirlwind
Mmmh
Farther and farther for you
A simple cliché
But I was scared of what you might say”
One big emotional whirlwind
Oh my god, I think I’m dying!
And then I felt it right within
How was your day?”
I still think you’re cute
But maybe it’s better this way
I just stared
And you grinned
We clicked like Legos
No one could compete (No one could compete)
You swept me off my feet
Too bad I stopped at “Hello”
It seemed too good to be true (It was too good to be true)
