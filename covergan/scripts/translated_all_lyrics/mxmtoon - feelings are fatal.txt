I could never tell you that I'm breaking slowly
But my feelings are fatal, my feelings are fatal
And that’s just too much, I don’t want to bother
It’s always for you and never for me
I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
So I'll keep it inside and bury it deep
How many times must I keep it inside
But I can’t tell you that I'm breaking slowly
I know it’s not healthy but you won’t hear a peep
I'm happy for you, I'm smiling for you
I'd do anything for you, for you
I need it to stop and I want to be able to open up
Though I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
Closed doors, locked in, no keys
I need to let go and I swear that I've tried
Keeping my feelings hidden, there is no ease
My feelings are fatal
And I need it to stop so let me tell you, please
But opening up means trusting others
