And knowing that it’s all for play
Creating crushes out of crowds
Though my glasses are tinted rose pink
But I can’t help that I like to think
I feel like Chet, it’s way too easy falling in love
I sit around all day just listening to love songs
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
I’m a hopeless romantic afraid of commitment
(Ooo-ooo-oooo-ooo-oooh)
Oh, isn’t that cheesy, oh, isn’t that cheesy
(My glasses are tinted rose pink)
I live on dreams above the clouds
I just lay awake hoping I’ll find the key
But I don’t talk and I don’t chat
I’d like to believe that something could happen with me
I feel like Chet, but I won’t chat
One simple chat, I’ve got no guard
Thinking about how someday my someone will come along
Molding stories out of clay
It’s all for play
It’s really bad, I fall too hard
