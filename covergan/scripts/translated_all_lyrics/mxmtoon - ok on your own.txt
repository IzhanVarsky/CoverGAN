Another confidant
I couldn't be your half
I just want a hand to hold
I had to go, I'm sorry
That even though it's over
My life isn't so cold
But I'll hold you in my heart
I need some time to myself
You can find how to be okay on your own
Ooh
But your story can not start until you've grown
It wasn't meant to be
To gain some confidence (Ooh)
I could use a friend (A friend, yeah)
Just forming out a whole
And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
'Til I can fall again
I hope you'll understand
I'm not so scared to admit
I can't complete you, baby
I just can't be the one that makes you feel at home
But now that it's all over
To gain some confidence
Find solace in your soul
I could use a friend
It wasn't meant to bе
You know it's not the end
I could use a friend, a friend, yeah
Thought that I'd feel empty
Maybe we knew that from thе start
So I can comprehend
Maybe we knew that from the start
