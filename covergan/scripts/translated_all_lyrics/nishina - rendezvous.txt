I don't want love that fits in
Skip boring scenes
Even if the landing on the moon is uneven
Relative velocity becomes
Beloved fools
Unpredictable
Go beyond the atmosphere
Space key with one click
Let's turn our eyes and kiss
Adults who can't get hooked are boring
Let's get irresistible and jump out
Suddenly when the blue and round globe overflows
Making love if you jump over one square
Let's escape tonight
With thoughts that made me Freeze
Burning inochimijikashi
Run run rendezvous
The night when the red thread was entwined as if it started from ,,
Plus perfection
Returning to outer space
Postpone what to do
Like a lie You take my breath away
Crazy night is not enough just for correctness
You are me and you are me
I don't care about others anymore
You are my amai darling
You take my breath away like the universe
Let's make a satellite for only two people
