I just hope not to do it, only regret
If you can't stop being you
Hurry up to pick you up now
Saying I like you, the yellow sunset
never hugged you
I wake up to the sound of the alarm bell
very occasionally you
I don't really know baby
Maybe your every day is your consideration for the pathetic me
It's not nerdy boy, it's you just sweet babe
A cool real man, sometimes you would want it
I want to be a wonderful lover
Can't stop being so damn nerdy
'Cause we're special you and I
I don't have
I can't sleep these days, every night
(Can you love me, love me, love me, love me baby)
I want to show you a burning love but
I'm just modest, I don't know, maker, I
Dress up the clothes you picked yesterday
I'm just happy because it's you
Looking at you who clicked like on a photo like that
in a crowded subway
But I can't stop being so damn nerdy
It's sunny after the rain
You know I'll be happy to see you like this
Do you smile when you look at me like that?
(I'm a nice guy, yeah
hot like a fire
Tell me why am I so damn nerdy
It's big enough to be carried on my back
I'll just be a nerd for you too
I hate being a nice guy, yeah)
I've been losing sleep for you, yeah
friend's boyfriend
The main character in this drama, yeah
The two of us together last week
I've been feeling like a huge nerd lately
Yeah I know you'll be compared
I don't understand, why the hell
I can't take my shoulders again, yeah
Why do you look at me like this
Love isn't like that, stupid
My feelings are free for you
How to kiss until your hair turns white
not manly
I wish I really could change for the better
