"It's sand, it's dawn, it's quiet, it's straight, it's full."
He is free, he is a wing, he is bleeding (new blood, new day!)
Your grandmother is growing up:
I am new
The old world is over
The flower becomes the parent
I'm on fire
It is said that you can fly like a bird only if you make your roots ashes
Breaks-bu-bu-bu-bu-sub
She was born tomorrow
Mom, Mom, Mom
Try, obey, bless, obey
The leaf becomes the father-father
It's a fire, it's a fire, it's a storm, it's a storm
The branches of the fire will grow and hug you, mother:
Who is he, who is he? "He's your son."
And the bottom is a rotten cradle:
I'm on fire
- Good
A little lock on the door
Who is he, who is he? "She was born tomorrow."
Fly, burn wings, burn your pair of wings
Who is he
It's a wing, it's a wing
That's it, that's it
Fire, fire, spark, spark
Creates, develops, breaks
Hi, Dad
(Who is he, who is he?)
I fly over the old world -
And one day no one breaks, does not harden, does not sink, does not obey
I'm new here
Fear the cradle
(new blood, new day)
I am the king
Fire
Here it is, a new day, a new ten;
Fear lies - the child falls
I do not break, I do not break, I do not obey - I burn side by side
He is born tomorrow - who is he, who is he?
He does not break, he does not obey
Passing through the earth to a black shadow -
It is a new language, it is a new knowledge, it is a new country -
Yana-yana, my soul is burning, my soul is burning, my soul is burning
The giant is growing up
Yana-yana, my soul burns, burns, burns my soul
Hardens, sinks, subdues
My mother
Only a burnt house does not need a lock
Born tomorrow
My father is myself
Good
I will not break, I will not break, I will not subdue -
Growing up, the giant is growing
The roots of the fire extend to the sulfur soils
(Who is he, who is he? Who is he, who is he?)
I will be born tomorrow
Dad, goodbye
Yana cup, around hot
