Actress Vesna Actress Vesna
Reads a ballet about nightmarish love and beautiful betrayal
Grimly grumbles about shattered nerves, that there is no reason to warm
Raises the smiles of passers-by by the chins

Dances poems about the cunning of heroes and the loyalty of rats

In the patched tailcoats of the facades, the parterre of the house was filled
And, being baptized, opens the seventy-fifth theatrical season
Let us live, let us sing until spring...

Sun-Secretary General procrastinates lorgnette in the imperial box
