Stardust on boots
just stay with you
But a star high in the sky
Calls me on my way
Trigger not pressed in time
My serial number on the sleeve
Our footprints
And there is something to pay, but I do not want
Easy chair, checkered plaid
Wish me luck, wish me luck
Wish me luck in the fight, wish me
Don't stay in this grass
Blood type on a sleeve
Victory at any cost
Warm place, but the streets are waiting
Sunny day in dazzling dreams
I would like to stay with you
I don't want to put my foot on anyone's chest
