And able to reach for the stars
And the clouds float above the city
And yellow smoke over the city
The city is two thousand years old
Stars named Sun
And two thousand years of war
And warmed by rays
After two, there are flowers and grass on it
And who should die young
A star called the sun
White snow, gray ice
War is the business of the young
City in a road loop
And fall singed
He does not remember any ranks or names
anti-wrinkle medicine
And we know it's always been like this
War for no reason
Lived under the light
Three years later she is alive again.
A patchwork quilt on her
Shutting down the heavenly light
Except that this is a dream
He does not remember the word "Yes" and the word "No"
What fate loves more
An hour later it's just earth
Who lives by the laws of others
Red-red blood
On cracked earth
