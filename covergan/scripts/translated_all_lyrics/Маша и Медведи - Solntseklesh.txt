This is their first flight.
Rings got dusty
Free your hands
And run faster
Decorate your fingers with gold
Sunflare dance
Drink yourself with the wind
If in your heart
Lost smile
Look for her and you will find
You won't fall
You will find her
Satisfy your hunger with a song
I'm sad tape
The dance will be light
Weave it in your hair
It's just a dance
