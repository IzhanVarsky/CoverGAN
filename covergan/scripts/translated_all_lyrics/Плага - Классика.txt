R.I.P, bro
Plaga became a rich motherfucker
Bitch on me is static, uh
I'm out of breath
Be careful mother
call me boss
The sea is no job bingo
E, their fuckers flew
From oxygen starvation
Your bitch saved me
The bitch is sad, there is panic in this bitch
fucking pneumonia
Bitch look, I'm like ice from the Titanic, eh
She's downstairs, blowjob, drool
E, e, my dick is long, like a building
Plaga fucked everyone - classic
Money on me - math
Chain on me, freezer
Pop Smoke, my boys are kingo
...
E, Plaga handed out soldering irons to everyone
