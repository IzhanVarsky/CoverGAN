Torment cash on bread, fuck the brand (cash)
Koresh, come on for yourself without allegories
You either want to but can't, or you can but don't want to.
Facts are what I use when writing a line, bra
You need an example who didn't do like everyone else to be stronger
Here the goal is to leave a story, something that will feed
Now the whole room, as I knew, I'll roll it into asphalt, hey, kid
I do not judge: there is the same moment - yet we are all, like everyone else
I'm sayin' get outta here!
Comment - bro, is that all you can do?
Tormenting cash on bread, I don't give a fuck about the brand, trout fishing (Woah)
We only differ in who uploads what information to the compartment
I fly low like a lowrider and get up early for work like Dana White
You won't even lift your ass: not King Arthur
Are you being dragged to the bottom? Don't pull and board
I don't believe you, you're a bad talker
Forget about the word rest
My brothers are with me, my dad is cooking bechamel next to me (Wag!)
My brothers are with me, my dad is cooking bechamel next to me
Speak to the point, but do not shake the ground
Torment cash on bread, fuck the brand (cash, cash, cash)
Get outta here, man, shit, I'm sayin'!
Torment cash on bread, fuck the brand (cash, cash)
I'm going to work, I don't make noise
If they want, they will find me
I move as I want - that is, as I can
You were raised just like your father
He is my friend - where is yours? Gone for bread, how old? (Woah)
For real, I'm sayin' get outta here, for real!
I blame the beat, and every beat is a harpoon
Against those who drown in the swamp, have you seen who is in the top?
You need an example who will show them the dick that he brought from outside
You want, but you can't, or you can, but you don't want to
(Wag!)
Music visited me, but it didnâ€™t fill my belly, we are connected with it by bonds for centuries (Alright)
Wag! Wag!
Sori, you and I do not live on repeat
