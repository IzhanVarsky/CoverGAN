Alarm clock about twenty times
How I hate you
I take wine and marshmallows
I go down to the store
Not knowing who was there before
You played with me like a pro
And choking on tears
In my dream you stroked my fingers
I'm wearing yesterday's dress
With me you were so gentle
You, knowing, nevertheless decided - this is not love
I was waiting for you, but you didn't come
Throwing on an old hoodie
What is there again for a small
So that cortisol does not cover
That we are now completely strangers
And I don't have the strength to wake up
And I did not understand, I could not forgive
I don't believe that
And brought like in a movie
How we burned those nights
You change them like gloves
Morning coffee in bed
Laughed on your air
And I'm completely naked
I'm under hypnosis, under the moon
Leaving my thousand calls unanswered
Now it doesn't matter
And why do you feel good in someone else's arms
Rays play on the roofs
Night again, night again, night again
You won't come, you won't come, you won't come
I won't see them again
I'll swipe to the cart I'm a widget
Fortune telling for love
I guess I didn't care
Laughing like I'm sick
Don't step into that river twice
Huddled in your apartment
And if you were not obedient, forgive me
I will remember you one day
Trains are leaving, there is an empty platform in the window
And I did not understand what you found in them
Maybe you forget me
