The streets are smiling at us
But I fall into them again, not noticing the wounds
You, you painted me from the inside
We have something to talk about
I'm ready for anything for love
But we just kiss
Ready to be wrong at night hundreds of thousands of times
Cupids admire us and
Let's not rush anymore
After all, we managed to do everything that was needed yesterday
But even if you are another mirage
Why does everything feel like a dream again?
Your lips are like thorns
