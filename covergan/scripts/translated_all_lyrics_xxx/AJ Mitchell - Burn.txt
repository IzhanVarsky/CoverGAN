We got red wine stains on the countertop
Nothing's gonna change until nothing remains
Tables turned, ripped the
I'm gonna let it burn (Let it burn)
Nothing's gonna change until we up in flames
And someone's gotta strike the match first
Roses right out of the dirt, ayy
Hate that I'm saying 'em first, yeah
What we had worked, I just
Oh, oh-oh, burn (Woo)
I'll say the words, I just
But we keep our pain all bottled up (Bottled up)
But for what it's worth
We got red wine stains on the countertop (Countertop, yeah)
We're frozen up, so I'm
Oh, oh-oh, burn
Oh, oh-oh, burn (Burn)
It's been too dark to see the light (See the light)
I'm gonna let it burn
But we keep our pain all bottled up
Can't watch it get any worse
I think what's best for us could mean the worst
How'd we get so cold? Damn, look at us
It's been too dark to see the light
To see the light we gotta watch it burn
Oh, oh-oh, burn (Even if it hurts)
Even if it hurts (Ooh na na)
Even if it hurts (Even if it hurts, yeah, ooh na na)
