And whoever tells you to go follow your dream
Don't be fooled by a dream
We stop in concern while chances keep on passing us by
It's not enough, this can't be all, it's not enough, don't let me fall
It's not enough, I won't give up until I climb atop this wall
Oh, oh, oh, there's no limit to what you can achieve
Oh, oh, oh, with all to lose and nothing to gain
There's no way that you will get any higher, higher
The future we're making is in the fabric we weave
Is a liar, a liar (Liar)
We live and we learn, we dream, then we die
So quench your desire, desire
Why even bother, all this effort just to get by?
No one is special, we're all just the same
There's no way of taking before we receive
We watch as it ceases, looking back at what we became
Is a liar, a liar (A liar, a liar, a liar)
There's a chance you'll get burned
So it's better to extinguish your fire, your fire
We're looking to others and living a lie
There's a line in the sand that you cannot cross
Don't let no one tell you what you should believe
We're placing the pieces, we're playing the game
It's not enough, you can beat me around
But you'll never see me crawl, you'll never see me crawl
