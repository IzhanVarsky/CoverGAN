And you will never know
But there was fear inside
To tell you how I feel inside
So here we are, all just the same
Or are we all just a little blind?
A witty line to save my face
And it’s a wasted love that we all regret
My fear entwined with my regret
To share another road
Cause there’s a thing called love that we all forget
There was a time, there was a place
Is it just me? I’d like to know
I’ll beat a path for safe return
And I haven’t lost my only chance
My secret plan, how close we came
To cross the line takes a tiny step
But will a spark cause the bridge to burn?
You live your life just once, so don’t forget about a thing called love
Don’t forget, forget about a thing called love
A parachute of pride
