Then I want you to know
Hey, look at us twice
I want you to never forget that I have your back too
And if I lose my head, you stand behind me
Now I just want you to know
Look over at me and immediately the feeling is there
And it gets complicated
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Even when we're discussing
And I want you never to forget
Yes, with the two of us
And my shy "How are you?"
Hey, you do me like that
Did you ever think we'd get this far?
Hey, you're doing me so good, yeah
The best thing here is you, yeah
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
If I don't show it
'Cause I don't want you to ever forget
From your little "Hey"
What I felt never goes away
Should never be different
When you face me, I know it'll stay that way
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
