We are happy from the inside, I know that, but what can I do if, deep down, I love you?
And I don't want to have you
And I can't have it
And I can't love you
I can't love you anymore
And the little face of me was not
I didn't want to wait for you
Dead in life I feel
I lost the romantic way of seeing life
My heart more and more like a stone than a sponge
I think I'm going to go crazy
I see you pass with your backpack
The love of my loves is you
And when I think of your love I have nothing left
with your smell of yesterday
Every afternoon I wait for you standing on the corner
You always forget that I exist
I don't want to have you anymore
But for me it doesn't matter
Not one more lap by your side I will give not one more attempt this is going to deserve
Now I leave you on seen
