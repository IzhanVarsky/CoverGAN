if you want to enjoy
Cumbia is the queen
without even looking
A cute brunette wiggles as she walks by
What if I dance alone
And she smiles at me
This cumbia when dancing
let me show you
that there is no harassing
And to the rhythm of the cumbia
She then she turns and tells me
sitting in the sand
And when you come and go from the sea
And when you let me go you'll see
I invite her to dance
