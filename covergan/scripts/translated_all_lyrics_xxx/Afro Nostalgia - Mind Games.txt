Wasn't mutual
At this point, I'm thinking, I'll probably die lonely
Spend time to figure you out with no manual
I'm spilling out my feelings, try not to sound corny
Such a beautiful mind had me out of the physical
I'm probably not lucky, this love shit not for me
But then I found out the love we had wasn't mutual
But girl, the feelings you had me feeling unusual
The girl I really love, don't even like me
When you said, you loved me
Wonder if that came from the heart
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind
Stop playing mind games
Stop playing mind, stop playing mind games
