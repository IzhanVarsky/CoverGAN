You know I won't refuse
I just caught the blues
I'm gonna follow you
Your body is aquatic
Looking at her move
So baby fight it (baby don't fight it)
No need of a parachute
Just Like the cameras do
Don't even doubt it (don't even)
I know that you like it
Your vibe is exotic
If you 'bout it
Till the end of time
You know that I fell for you
You know what I'm 'bout to do
Born in the s
Don't question my honesty
We don't need camera crew
You cure my neurotics (cure my neurotics)
Shawty is my muse
The way that I bite it
She came to my world
I picture me and you
I'm 'bout it
So don't get it confused
Lovin' the s
You glow like the flowers do
I'm gonna follow
Monochromatics (monochromatics)
She brought somethin' new
Whatever she asks
