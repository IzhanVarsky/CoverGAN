Guess you're the Empress
Baby girl let me ease your mind for a second
How's your day going
I'm her bullet proof vest
Sit on my lap
I think we need to chill
Till your mind get stable
I'm tryna impress you
Wrap you in my arms
She said, she feels safe with me
Yet I'm trynna invest
You're all I want
I wanna see that pretty face
No, I don't mean any harm
Free birds and we flying
Hit you up in the afternoon
That's a real life fable
Know, I'm trynna be the best
You are my ocean vibe
Hope you're not following where the wind blowing
I think I'm obsessed
Let's go!
Hoping you can see my effort
Hey sleepy head
Take you up on a journey
None of my business
And We should stress less
We built our own nest
Put your head on my chest
Hit you up with a morning like
Help you relax
(where the wind blowing)
It's been a long day
You're all I need
I wanna love you the best
