With a chip on my shoulder and egg on my face
And that's the reason why I’m outta clichés
Ooh, I've had enough
I'm gonna try
And if there's anyone that I should avoid
So if there's anyone that I should avoid
The more of me I give them, the less they give a fuck
Well, isn't it just my luck
And I failed to see the forest for the trees
But isn't it just my luck
I finally found us a mess to get into
The easier the answer, the more it tears me up
Ooh, you and I are nothing alike
The easier the surface, the more it cuts me up
For a moment I was making my way to the base
For the bait they put in front of my face
Little bobber in the water
You probably asked if I was really ever anything but ready
