Yeah, when I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Always thought I was losin' the race
Any problem, we'll figure it out
Never thought I was worth what you give
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Always thought I was too far from grace, yeah
And fall right into you (Oh)
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
And fall right into you
Yeah, you kill my doubts, they disappear
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around
I was numb before, but now I feel
Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Never felt quite alive, now I'm livin'
Like a rock, I was set in my ways
Really don't know how we made it here
Any broken heart, we'll make it heal
Any love lost, we'll bring back around
