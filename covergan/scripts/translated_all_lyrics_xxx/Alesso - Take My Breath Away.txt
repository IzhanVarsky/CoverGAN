Body high, swimming in my bed
Got me running right back
Want it, want it, want it, want it, and I want it now
We ignite, we're slipping like sand
Take my breath away
Pull me down to ecstasy
When you touch me like that
Burning lights, hang over head
Higher heights to shallow breaths
Holding tight, never, never end
Don't you know you excite me like that
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how
