Throw yourself to the ground to see who picks you up
Because with you everything everything is complicated
right now no no no
It's worn out and that's none of my business
The story is over there is no episode two
What did you like?
Dramatic very complicated oh oh ohâ€¦
Being single is today
I don't even look back to gain momentum
Had forgotten
I can't get used to your speech
No thank you very much
I live calm as I am right now
I do not argue is not cunning
I did not remember
why we thunder
leave my heart calm
The bad life and all the time make me dramas
And today that you come back to look for me it's clear to me
Your case is clinical, so critical
Yours is typical, illogical
I'm surprised what you asked
Speaking clearly I'm no longer interested
I'm not in the mood for love
