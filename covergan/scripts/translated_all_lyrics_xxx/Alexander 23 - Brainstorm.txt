'Cause there's not a dollar I wouldn't pay
(Where are you?)
But salt water is rolling down your neck
Wish you could stay with me instead
No, no, no, no, no
But I see no smoke down from the ground
Where you are
But when it comes to this, my money is
Oh, where do you go
Where do you hide
You swear to God the stairs are meltin'
Oh, where do you hide
Expensive green and white papier-mâché
You swear to God it's rain
When nobody knows where you are?
Oh-oh
How bad's the weather in your head?
What would it take for you to stay?
You say the building's burning down
Too far to hear me scream?
So what would it take for you to stay?
When you close your eyes? Is it far?
But I see they're safe and sound
Where are you?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
