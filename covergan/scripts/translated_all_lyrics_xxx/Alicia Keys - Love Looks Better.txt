Alright
Every day, yeah
Better learn how to dance
Just stop for a minute
You're all I ever wanted
Was a dollar and a chance
Coming, coming from the bottom
Run, run through the street now
Promise you, baby
Every day
Oh, can we touch for a second?
Was a city and some keys
And now it's you I'm missing
All I wanna do is you
Hold up
Feel like my love is wasting
So can we talk for a minute?
Find, find what you're made of
All I, all I ever wanted
Get so damn tired of chasing
Stop for a minute?
Be us for a second?
Find, find what I'm made of
Don't matter what I give it to
'Cause all I wanna do is you
My love looks better on you
