How you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
I wanna be your lost boy
Wishing we could start again
Wendy we can get away
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth
At the bar drinking way too much
Of great times with far better people
So here we go again
Tell me how you feel over and done with
I know I sound crazy
We sing along to "Forever Young"
Somewhere in Neverland
I promise if you’re with me say the word and we’ll find a way
We’ll talk about how your parents separated and
Wendy run away with me
Your "everything better" plan
Like your life is a map with no compass to guide
So here we go again wishing we could start again
Say hello to a job and the taxes
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Your last chance, a better reality
And weekends with our friends
The weekends with old friends spilling into to routine
Say goodbye to the halls and the classes
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out
And trying to feel forever young
Don’t you see what you do to me?
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
We’ll start a life of the plain and the simple
