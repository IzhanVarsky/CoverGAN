We need light, it's far too dark
In the air
Not too suave but understand
Images that can't compare
And everybody stops and stares
At the odd familiar
I've had my share, I've made amends
To the real thing
Open your eyes, don't lose that spark
And strangers, they stop and stare
In no need of decadence
They say I am not from here
A puff parade of elephants
A blank aura, chameleon
Staring at the second wind
