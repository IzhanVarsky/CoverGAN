Cut pole to pole
With no one aware
Layered like an onion
Caught on a stand
Acidic environs
Foreign to most
A room full of stares
Waters will rise
Drowning the sea
(Oooooooh)
Stuck in a cycle
A tired assertion
The tide is high
Out in the cold
Stuck on a stand
Does it scare?
Far too close
But it's not enough
A sordid affair
The end is nigh
The record repeating
I fill my cup
A subtle unnerver
Out of its lair
Spotting the scene
A casual observer
Is it old?
Sicken the host
Left for the vultures
