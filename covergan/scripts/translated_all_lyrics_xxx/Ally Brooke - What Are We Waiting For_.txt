Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Was about to leave (Ah-ah-ah)
Oh, I like we're dancin' slow and
I'm losing all my self-control
Losin' all self control
Hold on me tight and don't let go
Keepin' me distracted (Ah-ah-ah)
What are we waitin' for?
Oh, I like we're dancin' slow and (I like it)
Little loud as madness (Ah-ah-ah)
And focusin' on me, yeah
Wonder how far we go
Turnin' nothing into somethin'
The possibility
Keep my mind at ease (Ah-ah-ah)
What are we waiting for?
Hold me and don't let go
I don't know how we got this close
Had no plans to show up (Ah-ah-ah)
I do, baby do you? Woah
You came out of nowhere (Ah-ah-ah)
How we get this close?
Don't wanna leave alone
I can feel it, feel it coming
Dancin' until they close
Losin' all self control (Ah)
