Resuscitated too many times
All hands up for the big finale
I go interplanetary
When you hold me
Is this dead or is it alive?
Oh, your touch is haunting me
I circle it, too many sides
Make this up for the ceremony
The perfect innovation
It's so extraordinary
Supernatural
Supernatural, supernatural, supernatural
Must be a gift from a future crime
Creative science that we make
Is this dream state or awake?
So close to real we can't tell its fake
When you're simply holding me
