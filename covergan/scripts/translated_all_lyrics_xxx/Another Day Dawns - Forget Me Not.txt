My heart is on the floor
Forget me not
Done with the secrets
I’m done
Can’t kill me cause I’m in your head
Just an afterthought
When will this end?
All the sweetness beneath the scabs
I’m failing
Right down to the stem
Why can’t you listen?
Forget me, forget me not, forget me you can’t kill me
I’m breaking down
Burn me alive and do it again
You can’t kill me
I don’t need this
I’m torn to the core
End your hatred, I don’t play dead
How could you want this?
Pull me apart again
Why do I try when it hurts so bad
Erase me
With your secrets
