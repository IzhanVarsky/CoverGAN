And I’m still thinking like, "How I get so lucky?"
Staring at your waistline
Told me "A ladybug landed on you, honey"
And the person that I am becoming is you
I been staring at your face, I been staring at your face like
Hit me on the FaceTime we get lovey-dovey
Ladybug in honey
Even got the cake now
Yeah
People staring like it's summertime and I got scully
Waiting for the days I be kissing on your tummy
Hit me on the FaceTime tell me that you love me
I need you in tub, baby, like a rubber ducky
I'm like, "How I get so lucky?"
I'm always asking God like, "How I get so lucky?"
Taking online class, I'ma eat it while you study
Staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
But I still be thinking like, "How I get so lucky?"
Happy that I took the time to bag my baby like a cubby
Only thing I ever wanted was you
And the person that I am becoming is you, uh
Even call your ma like, "How I get so lucky?"
No comparing to your face ma
Pray to God, "How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?"
I've been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
It's no time that my mind go off and needing you every night like my iPhone charger, real
With you I never got nothing to do
How did I get so damn lucky with you?
How I get so lucky?
Call me on your break time
No sleep thanking God like, how I get so lucky
Wanna write "I love you" in your tummy
Hoping they become me
Sweet that I only bear with you if it’s gummy
Childbearing is your waistline
Even call your grandma like, "How I get so lucky?"
Putting a little oney in your egg like the Easter Bunny
She be lookin' like she from another country
How I get so lucky, how I get so lucky?
I been staring at your face like, "How I get so lucky?"
Staring at your face like
Call you on your break time
Death due us part, I'ma Tiller no Kentucky
Stuck in a love and I'm lucky
Yeah, yeah
