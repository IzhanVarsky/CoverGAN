You so smart with a twinkle in your eye, who could turn your brightness down?
I yell at my G like, "Whats wrong with the service in here?"
Don’t be hard on yourself, I just need to multitask better
You give me life I don’t break you cause I’m responsible
And every time we run into a fuckin’ red light
And every time I turn on the T.V., it’s only static
In a realm where they give corny niggas a orphanage, damn
My head turn every time hearing you alert
No heart eyes—guess I ain’t handsome
I ain't find love but I found a charger though, uh
Connected is a crucial, I need a question answered—ask Google
I keep you covered 'cause your only glass sweater
Shorty argue with the waiters like, "Whats wrong with the service?"
On you making me antisocial
Guess I'm still in love—who could break my phony habits?
Forget the cookies with my Chinese, that's less fortunate
And lately I been feeling assumptions are kinda fickle
Yeah
The orders they follow so insubordinate
Shorty knock you out my hand she jealous
Still in the car, three minutes away from home
Would hate to watch you fall like a ornament made of porcelain
But I hold yo' home down—we can start over—okay, I’m sorry
I’d rather pick you up then to pick up a holy passage
I’m waiting for you to give me the signal
I can’t have shining on the ceiling o’clock in the morning, that conversation ain’t that important for real
I’m always checkin your background
You gotta paint the shit that you facing, thats self portrait
And I’m tryna find the coordinates
Appreciation for applications you carry got me lost in that other world
In that other realm it’s like a tournament
Which is mainly the reason they don’t look the same in real life
Shorty said, "Where the waiters in here? I’m tryna purchase."
I guess I’m still in love—who can break my phony habits?
This shit is horrible, this day in age it’s so inaudible
I got a plate of food—let me take a picture of it first
Only time you piss me off is when I did drop you on my nose
You ain’t the reason that I crashed my car
Don’t need a mirror when I got you there looking at me, uh
But it makes sense, so I can be on you all day
Putting others in danger, only care about yourself don’t you?
One domino effect all the dominoes
You almost died last night talking to my friends
Vibrating every second so you hail boastful
Not knowing I need that pat on the back to feel like the shit
I keep you face up right on the dinner table case you got something to tell me
Before I put her face first in the pillow, I’m a put you face first in the pillow, then you on silent
My head down all the time so I’m so focal
Or when you freeze for no reason, I be yelling in yo face
Nobody follow back, I ain't gon' be shit in this world
You was never on my rug every night
I made sure my hands gave you a hug every night
No filter to human body when it’s vaguely in site
I hooked you up right before I fell asleep, right?
So when I wake, it’s obvious you a hundred percent
Waking up, it's a ritual just to look through you
I hold you in the sky when I brush my teeth
Don’t be keeping you safe or remotely as treasure
When I got you in my hand, I don’t be making no disturbance
And I’m constantly looking for ya’ll approval
When I lay down, I look up to you like I suppose
On the way I live my life, ya’ll push me one forth of the way
But with the same finger scroll right pass like I don’t exist
Why you making me tell my friends that I’m home but I’m not yet
I wanna shake off my addiction, I’m slowly at it
With zero likes—guess I ain’t important
You was cheating on me with the plug every night and it's cool
I always see how much of attention that I can give you
Maybe I got to show ‘em something from my past just to get love, they quick to rejuvenate what you had
Yeah, who could break my phony habits?
Quarter push like the carts at price right
I ain’t even on my block yet, at green lights you was making me post like a drop step
Waking up, it’s a ritual just to look through you
