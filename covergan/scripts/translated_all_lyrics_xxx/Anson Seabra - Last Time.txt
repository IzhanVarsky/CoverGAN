Guess the last time wasn't the last time after all
We must be insane cause
So why are we like this
What a sad sight
They say insanity is trying the same thing
We are caught in a past life
I moved fifteen blocks away
As you said you needed space
And I know you know it too
It seems like it never ends
So blind to consequence
Thought that last time was the last time
Now everyone but us
We keep trying this expecting to pull through
Then I drink too much and call
We are running around again
But I know that that's not true
I say we are better off as strangers
Now I'm waking up in your bed
Can see that this is done
But expecting something new
