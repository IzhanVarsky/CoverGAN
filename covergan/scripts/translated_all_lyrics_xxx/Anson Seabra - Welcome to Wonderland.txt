Holding your hand under sapphire skies
Welcome to Wonderland, we've got it all
Welcome to Wonderland
Let's go exploring or we could just go for a walk
Maddest of hatters, the Cheshire Cat
Where should we go?
Make an appearance and maybe they’ll sing us a song
There's a tea party along down the road
Memories for when morning comes
Potions and pastries that make you grow tall
Laughing till the morning comes
Is the song that's inside of your heart
Don’t let it leave
Nothing around here is quite as it seems
Welcome to Wonderland, look where you’re at
And the only thing sure from the start
Underneath the stars
Forests and cottages, castles and cards that can talk
Everyone that leaves has a heavy heart
Now that I must leave with a heavy heart
Dancing through a dream
Not sure if anything is real or a dream
If this was a dream then at least I’ve got
Welcome to Wonderland, I’ll be your guide
Magical cabins and lovely white rabbits with clocks
Oh, Wonderland, I love
