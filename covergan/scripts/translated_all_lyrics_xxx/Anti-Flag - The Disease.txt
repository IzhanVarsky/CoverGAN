You have a sickness
We are the voices and we reject you
We are the whisper of the lit fuse
You are the cancer
We are the fire in the attic
And we are the disease, we are the disease
We are the echo of violent truth
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
We are the roll call of the pursuit
We are the voices in the static
(Your apathy feeds the machine)
Critical shutdown of false virtue
(You're a disgrace of the disease)
The viral outbreak to kill the untrue
We are the disease
Apathy is feeding the machine
(The misery, the company)
Hello?
Misery loves the company
(And we reject you, and we reject you)
That brings you to your knees
Yeah, we are the disease
And we are the disease
