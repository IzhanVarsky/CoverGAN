Don't have the time to go through
All the things I wanna show you
And suddenly you're sober
Glad you're not me
All the things I wanna show you (show you)
And suddenly we're sober
With their head upon your shoulder
Cornered by your self-obsession
Take your time and tell me what you're thinking
Tied your tongue and fucked it more
It's like I'd never known you
What is it you're waiting for?
The hardest way to learn your lesson
You've got a chance to say it all
(Is learning from me)
Get your kicks from someone else
Just 'cause someone says it's over
Don't look at me
