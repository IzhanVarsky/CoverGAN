That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
I'm not one to stick around
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Can't fight this no more (Can't fight this no more), it's just you and me
Mmm
Hey, yeah
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I'd rather do
But you never let me down, no, no
If you told me that the world's endin'
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
Ah
(That's just for fun)
I could stay here for a lifetime
I lock the door (Lock the door) and throw out the key
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
Don't care if I sound crazy
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
Woah
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't trade
Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
I could stay here forever
(I'm stuck with you)
So, go ahead and drive me insane
You, oh, oh
So, lock the door and throw out the key
I'ma get to know you better
Go on, make me lose my mind
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
(What?)
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with
All this lovin' you, hatin' you, wantin' you
One strike and you're out, baby
Got all this time on our hands
There's nobody on these streets
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
Ain't no other way that I can spend it
Kinda hope we're here forever
Baby, come take all my time
We got all that we need here tonight
