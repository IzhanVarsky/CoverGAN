Then you disappear from me and I don't really understand why
I have to confess that sometimes I don't like the way you are
You get in a weird mood with every full moon a month
Just having you close, I feel like I'm starting over
I have to confess to you now, I never believed in happiness
But everything else beats the good you give me
You don't say anything romantic when the sunset comes
If you go up and down and you're not
You don't need to change anything
Sure of what you feel
Just having you close I feel like I'm starting over
I love you as you are
I love you if you come or if you go
I love you with lemon and salt
Then I come to meet with your eyes they give me something else
(Is it over already?)
Sometimes something looks like it, but it's pure chance
