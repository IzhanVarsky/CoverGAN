I breathe you nah-nah
I feel you nah-nah
That it's tearing me apart
Can't leave you nah-nah
I need you now, nah-nah
Then circle back and say, "I'm ready now"
You're all I want, if you could only see
I want to know cause you're a mystery
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
It's like you love to see me on my knees
You watch me burn and then you smile at me
Are you aware you get the best of me?
I need you nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
You're like a rhythm, take control of me
And your hands are on my heart
When I'm away, girl, are you missing me?
You're like a wave that's washing over me
But you're the only one I'll ever need
'Cause I, I need you nah-nah
You walk away right when I'm down and out
And you're tearing me apart
Just like a roller coaster, round and round
