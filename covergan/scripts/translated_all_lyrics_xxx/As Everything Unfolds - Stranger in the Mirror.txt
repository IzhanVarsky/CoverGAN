I won't let it wear this hollow crown
I just can't seem to find the answer
The black dog, it comes, it hunts, it follows you
Lеt me drown
The stranger in the mirror is smothering me
All my darkest fears arе laid out one by one
Pull me out, pull me out or let me drown
Let me drown
Breathe it in, I let it consume me
A shadow moving closer
Grabbing hold of what I want to believe
Active in the problems I so tried to avoid
The raging flames around me
An outline of the person that I once was
It creeps up on you, it drags you down
It's not fiction anymore, it's so very real
Crawling inside like there's no one home
We run from our problems like there's no tomorrow
A victim of my mind and it's only just begun
Our reckless minds are so tainted in sorrow
I told myself I wouldn't become this
A fire that's burning, it catches on my soul
