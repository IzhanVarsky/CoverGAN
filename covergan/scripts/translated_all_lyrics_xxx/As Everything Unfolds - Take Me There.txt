Allow yourself to see the light, question and defy
But the devil, he lives within us
We have faltered on all your advice
Take me there, to the place where you reside
We shall not stand in cages
Sweet comfort in your close kept lie
Your holy words are nothing but you still try
Are we tainted or is it human nature?
Gives you right to criticize what path we come through
Blindly led to faith with no choice who we meet at the gates
Where apostates become divine
Take my hand, let's set you free
Only free when we let our minds unleash
Question and defy
Just because you believe He loves you
We have called out for you in the night
The sight of heaven is all around us
We won't live words from pages
It's not sinful living life as strangers
No sign, no feeling, no hand of healing
Apostates become divine
All I know has been taken away from me
