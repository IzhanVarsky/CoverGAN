Drowning my body
Follow it up
It always ends bad
What you call home
Rain starts to fall
How long has it been
Deep in the ocean
Love is a wave
Inside our bodies
This time it won't
It's always been you
Finally, I know
I call redemption
Dormant inside me
End
To where it begins
Drenched to the bone
Finally, it's clear
I swim to you
Anagnorisis
Around our bodies
Sleeping away
Peripeteia
