Silver boots make when they're fleeing town
A sundial for the gods
Only
Perpendicularly only
All my body's undulating
On the road on which we're bleeding
Strikes my heart and sheds some light on
All this pain we're generating
Love, honey, this ain't love
So much time, my teeth are whitening
I want you to hold me
That we wrongly have been naming "love"
Back and forth but it’s too late and
We were born, born to fail
This prolonged, insane, grotesque thing
From the blood we shed while biting
There's no cure and no sedating
To the fact it ain't so frightening
How there hasn't been your pretty sight in
Born to fail
Pretty soon, I will be feeding
And I can't get around to being
Honey, this ain’t love, no
On the taps your little feet in
Love, honey, this ain’t love
It's raining cats and dogs and lightning
Much surprised by memories speeding
