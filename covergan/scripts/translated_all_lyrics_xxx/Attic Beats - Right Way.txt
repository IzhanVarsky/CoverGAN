I'd hate to see you go
Imma love you in the right way
I don’t mind babe
Been running from your demons lately
Pick a night, any day
Holding onto nothing good
I’m sure that I can arrange that
I don't mind babe
Honey, we don't have to slow down
I can love you in the right way
No matter what you do or say
I’m there on a daily basis
Tell me what you really want now
So I'll make sure I'm the only one
Looking for a piece of mind
I'm sure that I can arrange that
Searching in the wrong places
Don't worry, I'm not out of town
