Do you still think, think about me?
We were feeling, falling in deep
When you close your eyes
Are you empty now?
Wanna know the way you move
Are you, are you empty now?
We were happy then
Please dream of mine
Wanna know the way you think
Am I in your head?
When it's just you, you in your room
Remember how we used to be
What did you forget?
