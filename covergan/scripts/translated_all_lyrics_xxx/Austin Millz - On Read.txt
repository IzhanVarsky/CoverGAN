Payin' the fee 'cause my time ain't free
But it's hard to see when you act so whack
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
A lil' more than wanna give each week
A couple long nights, make you feel single
I'II just leave you on read
On read, the metaphor spill out
'Til you outta my head
You throw the same fit
The game I done been out, only call me when you need
I never listen
Had to let go
'Cause everything's sweet, right
I recouped it all, now it's time to leave
'Ti you outta my head
All that hear is the same thing
Played the cards wrong, now I'm yellin', "Uno"
Knew I had you on a lease now it's time to pull my rent out
Water me with lies then the less I grow
Shawty's callin' every week, right, right
All that I hear is the same thing
Head, head, head, head
I feel like we already know
Always booked, never free, right, right
A couple goodbyes better than a fake hello
I was just thinkin' the same thing
You say it's my fault
You say it's my fault, I never listen
I'II make my bed and lay in that
We been on this road here before (Before, before)
The more you speak, seem the less I know
Fact or fiction, it's all pretend
'Cause love don't live here anymore, so
Playin' the blame game
Selfish, I know
Was just thinkin' the same thing
Never really tried to relate with you
I don't feel no shame for that
And no need to text back, baby
Done with the small talk
It's all the boy saw when the text message sent out
Checks comin' from the beats so my number is reserved
'Til you outta my head, right
Just leave it on read
Haha
Guess I'II take some blame for that
Never listen
You got somethin' special
Head, head, head, right
Saw you at a penthouse, so had to pull my pen out
You've done it again
