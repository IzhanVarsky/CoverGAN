Run away like you never believed in anything at all
A sweetness I've been craving
Run away from the tress
(Will you help yourself now
Run away like you never believed in anything else
When does the ripe fruit fall
I am not waiting for you no more
I'm over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, I'm over you (Over, over)
Over, over, over, over
With your hands above your head
We fear we're confessing
Into our laps for taking?
I am a mountain grown out of work
Maybe you're just jealous?
You dedicated, I'm over you
Like love asks you to?)
Anything at all
You've had a warning you just ignored
I'm so tired of listening to you
You owe me a romance
When do the seasons change?
Run away from the trees
