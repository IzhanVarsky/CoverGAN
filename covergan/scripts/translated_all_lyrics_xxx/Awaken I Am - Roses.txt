I forget, let's blame it on that glass of red
Is this fair?
'Cause roses don't know when they're dead
I feel that we're close to the end
(Know when they're dead)
Then you looked me in the eye
We roll over and play pretend
Roses don’t know when they're dead
It's am and I’m gripping on a cigarette
And make my blood course through my veins
Said I’ll never be the guy
As usual, we fight
Guess we'll blame it on that glass of red
My head's a mess, when you’re in it
Now we're taking off your tights
With one foot hanging from the edge
Roses don't know when they're dead
Guess I fell asleep in my car again
Who can hold a to and I'll never make the time
You shift your head and meet my gaze
I feel that we’re close to the end
I tell myself to walk away
Now fill me in, were you into him or just upset?
And battle with my self-restraint
(Know when they’re dead)
