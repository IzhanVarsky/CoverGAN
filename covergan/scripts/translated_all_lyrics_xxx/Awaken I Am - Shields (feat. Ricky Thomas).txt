A rhetoric sign to be left alone
To drag me from my throne
I won’t compromise
What must I lament for
I stand on my own
(In your mind) That we must now intertwine
Quiet I bide my time
The future is letting you near
Waiting for resolution
I’ve taken chances deploring advances
Take your toll
Always be finding me
It makes the mirror harder to see
These crowded spaces
There’s yours and there’s mine
This time
And I feel like I’m the only one
I gave you my all
Somebody to leave me whole?
All forgotten
Preparing their cages
(In my mind) But I’m not feeling alright
Beneath the defeat
It’s something I should know
Waiting for you all
(In your eyes) By a subconscious line
I won’t be disguised
From patient to anxious
New and old faces
Live with the burden
Savoring silence
Reveling in seclusion
Our place has been divided
These rules will always be guiding me
By a hand in tonight
Avoiding blind shoulders
Like dogs around a bone
(In my eyes) I feel I own this right
Take this indulgence
I’ve had my turn
Within your reach
