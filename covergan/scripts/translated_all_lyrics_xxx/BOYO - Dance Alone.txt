Make me seem untangled and unknown
I just mind the tone
I know I'm not the culprit but I'm on my fucking own
Comedian, keep me on my toes
Amnesty and anguish on the phone
I dance alone
Speaking of impermanence I know
No more
Lets dance alone
I don't mind the judgment no
I can speak your language if you want
Dressing up in all my father's clothes
We could laugh in shoulders, in cold
Keep me at an angle don't forgo
