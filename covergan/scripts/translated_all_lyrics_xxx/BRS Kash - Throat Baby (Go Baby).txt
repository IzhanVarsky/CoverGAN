She ain't even gotta ask for attention (Why?)
Grip like pliers, I feel it tighten
Made a whole song, see, I ain't frontin'
And I got beans you bite down
'Cause I'ma give it to her (What else?)
I need you, wanna see you
BOA head, make me cum instant
Sexy lil' redbone, yeah, I spend a bag on her
My soul wet, need your anointing
No relations, feeling, fighting
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
I go to war for you
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Sexy lil' redbone, yeah, got a good head on her
Extra lil' forty, gotta come right now
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Lovin' the, lovin' the mouth
Balls and all, with her mouth, she clean it
I shoot the world for you
Girl, I got plans for you, got a couple bands for you
I like the stance on you, good mouth got me like, "Ooh, ah"
Head monster, set an appointment
Way too good, may buy you somethin'
Clock on rocks, I give it to her
With a mouth like that, she can talk her way out goin' to jail
With a mouth like that, if you go to jail, I'll pay your bail
Suck this dick, then she dip, ooh
Damn, bae got me trippin'
Head like that, shit, pussy, don't need it
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Washing machine trick, ooh
Suck me up for an hour, I can't help but buy you flowers
Shawty got mean grip, ooh
Know what she came to do
Ooh, ah-ah, ooh, ah, ah-ah
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)
When she get hungry, she eat my semen
When we meet, I get excited
She gon' blow and she gon' ride it
Super good head, no cap, gown
Got a lil' hundred, that's if you want it
Since the first time, I been fiendin', couldn't even believe it
Money, I give it to her
