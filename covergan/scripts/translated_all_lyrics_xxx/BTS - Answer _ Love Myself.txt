I'm still looking for myself again
I wake up in the dark
I'll show you what I got
There is only one answer, ayy
Even the scars are my constellations, ayy
(Oh-oh-oh)
act right for me
Yesterday's me, today's me, tomorrow's me (Woah)
to meet those countless stars
even just loving me
Somehow, this is not the answer (Alright)
Frightened eyes, old questions
I should love myself (Oh-oh-oh)
more beautiful beauty
thick rings in your life
cold night gaze
I see you in the mirror
The road to my love (No way)
Whose permission did you need?
There might not be an answer (Yeah, yeah)
Yes, that beauty (Uh-huh)
I'm not afraid because that's my existence (Love myself)
(SUGA) Maybe more than loving someone
After winter, spring will come again
I should love myself (I'm learning how to love myself)
There is a heart to know (Alright)
Sad me, sick me
I'm clumsy
Yesterday's me, today's me, tomorrow's me
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I tossed and turned a lot, ayy
Because he is also a part of you, you
But I don't want to die anymore
from the beginning of the beginning
(I'm learning how to love myself)
Answer me with all my breath and the path I've walked
The more difficult thing is to love yourself
Let's be honest, let's admit it
What I need the most
Still inside of me (Oh-oh)
Why do you keep trying to hide it?
Uh, what's going on for me now (Ayy)
To hide my shabby me
those thousands of splendid
Did I fall for (Hey-ey-ey)
to the end of the end
Our life is long, trust me in the maze
attitude for me that's happiness for me
caused by my mistake
Into your mask (Hey-ey-ey)
Now let's forgive ourselves
You've shown me I have reasons
Without exception, without leaving behind, everyone is me
The arrow's target is me, ayy
When the sound of your heart beating is unfamiliar
Answer me with all my breath and the path I've walked (Oh-woah-oh)
The standards you set are stricter for you
