I scream with all my might
I can't reach any song
Grab my lost ankle again yeah, yeah, yeah
Do your thang
Oh, that would be my first death
i'll jump in
I been always afraid of
no more listening to music
I keep losing focus
What's my thang?
nothing can swallow me
I can't hear any sound yeah, yeah, yeah
Even if you pass me by in the dark
i saw me
How could I ever die like this
Only the sound of a slow heart in my ears bump, bump, bump
Even if you want to escape, jump into that mouth, jump, jump
Deeper
Do your thang with me now
Yeah, I think I'm goin' deeper
Slowly I open my eyes
Tell me now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If this makes me cry no more
Do you hear me? Yeah
Film it now, film it now
Killin' me now, killin' me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you can't make my heart tremble more
Let me go now, I hate it
Slowly sinking as if possessed nah, nah, nah
Scream silently
The sea where all the light is silent yeah, yeah, yeah
But what if that moment's right now, right now?
Only the sound of a fast heart in my ears bump, bump, bump
Open your eyes and jump into my forest, jump, jump, jump
What's my thang? tell me now
strong waves
I'll never be taken away again
in the deepest
Time seems to have stopped
I'd rather go on my feet
Inside I saw myself, myself
Ayy, say your heart ain't beating
Every moment becomes eternity yeah, yeah, yeah
This is my studio, my studio
tell me now
Even if I struggle, the floor is everywhere nah, nah
Tryna pull up
