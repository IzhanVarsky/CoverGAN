(Woo) I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I changed everything just for you
I don't even know who I was
(Woo) I just know, I just know, I just know why
I make up pretty lies for you
Why you sad? I don't know
Now I don't know me, who are you?
I could pretend to be happy even when I was sad
I changed into the me you liked
Smile, tell me you love me
Erase me and try to be your doll
Even if it hurts, I could pretend to be strong
May love be perfect only with love
I used to know you well
Love you so mad, love it's so mad
In a dream that doesn't come true
(Woo) I don't know either me or me
What is love, it's all fake love
Talk to the mirror, who the hell are you
it's unfamiliar
Cuz its all fake love, fake love, fake love
I hope all my weaknesses are hidden
Even you can't understand me
Love you so bad
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I forgot the route I came from
No, it's not what, I'm blind
say no
I grew a flower that could not bloom
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love
I gave you the world just for you
Look at me, I have abandoned even myself
In our own forest, you didn't exist
if it's for you
Love you so bad, love you so bad
I wanna be a good man just for you
