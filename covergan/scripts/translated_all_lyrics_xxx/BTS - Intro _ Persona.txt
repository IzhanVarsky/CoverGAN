The superhero I wished for
to vomit me
I called it hesitation
But I know one thing
Oh, do you wanna go?
I don't know man
The world really doesn't care
this is my soul map
How you feel? How are you feeling now?
have you already forgotten
This is the measure of the direction I want to hang
What kind of muse am I?
"Who am I?" A question I've been asked my whole life
Yeah, my name is R
Ah shit
if you could answer
The me you love and the me I create
I still don't know what
God bless you with so many beauties
Whether under the stage or under the lights
Who the hell am I?
Yeah I may have been deceiving me
first question
Smile more often than before
Some say run, some say stop
you didn't make it all
You know it comes out when you're drunk, it's like drunkenness
hot like a haze
my name three characters
I just wanna give you
Sometimes even hypocritical and vicious
After that
Tell me all your names baby
I want to be who I want people to be
The smiling me, sometimes the crying me
my flaws i know
Each time you made me stand up again
All the voices 'til I die
Others will come and wear pearl necklaces
How come that's actually my everything
Times that there is no turning back
never hesitated
it was just good
She says look at the wild flowers
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna fly?
The question you'll probably never find an answer to in your lifetime
But more and more things are being said
keep appearing
hey why did you start doing this
I made myself
You keep staring at me oh shit
I just wanna go I just wanna fly
he wants to see the forest
Cock tuk
What is my calling
Even now, every minute, every minute, we live and breathe
I may have been open-minded, but I'm not ashamed
Do you think you're alive?
Sometimes it just seems like bullshit
you just have someone to listen
my shadow
I really like it, but it's a little uncomfortable
What kind of music is me?
I remember and people know me
Even if I twist it like a habit
It should come first but
All the shoulders when you cry
With regrets that I can't get tired of anymore
With just a few words for a guy like me
What kind of truth am I?
Am I a dog or a pig?
Where's your soul?
Because it doesn't have to be hot or cold
Dear myself, you never lose your temperature
Where's your dream?
So I'm askin' once again, yeah
I think it's real now
my clumsy
Persona
Every night I roll around disgustingly
