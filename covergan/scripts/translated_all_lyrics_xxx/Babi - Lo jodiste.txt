I'm done (I'm done), for having to pretend, when I lost you
It's over, I feel like a joke
brawling hormones
If I have not yet made the threat of breaking the shell
I have to apologize
Descend on your hair (Ah-ah-ah)
when gray reigns
Give me your hand, let's bite the sky
I told you to come back but you didn't want to (-sists)
I wanted to tour you and you messed it up (You messed it up)
In a hostel with the desire to eat my last dance
I descend in your hair (I descend in your hair)
Shit, I should have been alert
Where I go?
And where do I go?
I descend in your hair
You turned it off, baby, you fucked it up
My mind and its gin would drink from temptation
I say that I forget you and I compose another song for you
I always had you more in mind than my own goals
By your waist painting missteps
Good, the penalty is back
It's over, I feel like a joke (It's over)
You turned it off, baby, you fucked it up (You fucked it up)
I wanted to be (I wanted to be), breeze for you, laughter for you, everything for you
I wanted to be a breeze for you, laughter for you, everything for you
And today karma avenges my mistake
It's over (It's over) I already feel like a joke (It's over)
blame me for the inconvenience
Hunger came together
I ended up having to pretend, when I lost you
I know if I had you near
We are two babies, doing the canelo (Yeah)
And where do I go? (oh)
Knowing little, little by little the money
We are two kids, doing cinnamon
Think wrong and right, my love
