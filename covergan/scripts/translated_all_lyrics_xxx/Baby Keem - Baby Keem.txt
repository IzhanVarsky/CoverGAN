Just to get that pussy, I'm gon' lie to you
I heard your bitch wear Skechers, woah
That made my smart bitch jealous, woah
What's your favorite color? Oh, that's mine too
My bitch need no effort, woah
Nigga, meet me in Transylvania, nigga
Straight to the curb, she headed, woah
I just took that nigga pack, won't give it back, ooh
We levelin' up
Ayy, seven figures, she like seven figures
Morning, I chill with the plug, then we get up at night, ooh
She gon' play with the nana when she wake up (Bae, wake up!)
He's not done yet, nigga
We gon' have a good day, get your nails done
Now she all on Twitter, claimin' I'm a nigga
Yes, I like you, girl, I don't want to front
She won't get a text back, I'm on ten and she mad, ayy
Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo
I just took that nigga bitch, I gave it back, ooh
I'm a young nigga, I'm irresponsible, ayy
Lay you in the bed, bae, let's cuddle up, uh, yeah
Two-phone Baby Keem, fuck me if you want, ayy
Fuck you mean? Bitch, I'm Baby Keem
Who the fuck told you we was done, nigga?
Unapologetic, I run up the racks (I run up the racks)
Offend you when I say it, I won't take it back
I got me a cheekbone fetish, woah
Diamonds do the Macarena, that's Fourth of July, ooh (Fourth of July!)
Promised I won't tell it, woah
We goin' for the re-up, you already know what that means
Had to run up in her, had her in the sprinter
Assist your ho, no pressure, woah
I'm gon' fuck this nigga bitch 'cause she got what I like, ooh
Big money off in the desert, woah
