Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that (Yeah)
You know I love it when you talk dirty
Baby Keem, not a wave, I'm a vibe, ho
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Young nigga sneakin' in through your side door
Post on your block with your wish list on me
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
When you come see the crib, you better die, ho
I hate a bitch that I can't impress
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy (Ayy, pull up, ayy)
Now I'm finna lay you on the mattress
You want me be the man you can vent to?
Six figs on the whip, that's a price tag
You let me beat it up, you let me practice
You act like a lil' me, I wanna fuck you
Lil' best friend bitch tried to press me
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
Seven fig nigga with the big drip on me (Yeah)
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
My lil' baby low-key a flexer
You the type to kill me, I won't touch you
I'm that underground nigga with the check, though
Messy, you my orange soda shorty
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
