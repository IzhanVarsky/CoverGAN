Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid (Huh, huh)
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I'm done, bitch, go to your room
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
Had to influence the wave
Like she's entitled to it
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Drive to the crib on the lakes
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
I stopped wearin' VVs
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
I get the top while I skeet off (Huh)
For the ones down, I say, "Free y'all"
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
I start to question what freedom is
Hop in the ship, go to space
I get the call and I go
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
Y'all gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
(Huh, huh, huh)
I am above all the rules
I am above the buffoons, stop it
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
Even if I take a loss
I learned that shit from the gunners
Look at my wrist, it say "Freeze, freeze"
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
I need another exit at the show
Eat the pussy so good
'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic' (Huh)
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
So what is the use of my dick?
But these are not regular clothes
I give 'em ten and be done with it
