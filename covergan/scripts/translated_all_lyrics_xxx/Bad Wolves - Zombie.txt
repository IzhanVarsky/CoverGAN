It's the same old theme in
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
What's in your head, in your head?
When the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?
Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
We must be mistaken
And the violence causes silence
In your head, in your head, they are dying
Child is slowly taken
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
In your head, in your head, they are crying
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
Another head hangs lowly
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
