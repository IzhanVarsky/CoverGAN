Let the music take control
Great music
Everybody sing this song with me
Back in
On the radio
Wrote this song
Thank you sir
For the music
To all the bands that play
Music
Let the music take your soul
For all of you
The songs play the music
Out there
DJ plays a song
With its catchy melody
I knew what I would be
Listen night and day
And simple harmonies
As the music plays the band
