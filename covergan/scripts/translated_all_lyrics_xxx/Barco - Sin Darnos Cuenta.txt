It wasn't perfect, it was just what we could
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
With a burning heart and new marks on my skin
I do not forget what I lived
wherever you are, wherever
Made a whirlwind, our bed split
while the world burns
May your morning light up
that divides our wave
It's not over, the window is still open
While the world burns, burns, burns
It wasn't perfect but it was what we wanted
I no longer believe in the border
And without realizing it, the hurricane passed
And without realizing all that happened
And that you can be a little more at peace
Every once in a while that light goes out
