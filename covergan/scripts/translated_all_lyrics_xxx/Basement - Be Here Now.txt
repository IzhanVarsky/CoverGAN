I'm trying too hard
I said it, I said it
I'm selling lies again
All the things you said
I'm breaking from the inside out
I lost myself in the moment
I'm in it, I'm in it
I hate it when I've lost myself in the moment
It's looking like I lost myself in the moment
Here now, be here now
When I'm in my head
No more surprises when
Why can't I just be here now?
To make it, to make it
I end it, I end it
Face to face or miles away
Here now, here now
I sold a smile today
