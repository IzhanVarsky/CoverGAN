(Lost all my sense of time)
Promise me you'll find a way not to be disconnected
Feel like I'm sinking and there's no way to get out
Can you help me out?
My prodigal son, what have you done?
Return while there's something left
(Lost all my)
With time while there's something left
Lost all my sense of time
To make you feel this disconnect?
Can't see the other side
Onto this carousel that won't stop moving
Please do not forget this is what you wanted
Have I been away too long to stop this?
My prodigal son, what have you done
And I'm too scared to get up
I can see the other side, I
Feel like I'm sinking, I
Can I go back to where I started?
I close my eyes as I keep going
I've lost all my sense of time
