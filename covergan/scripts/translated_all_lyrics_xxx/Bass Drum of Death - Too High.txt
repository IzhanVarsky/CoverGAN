I'm used to feeling faded
And if it drives me crazy
I'm alright now, I'm alright now
They got me feeling dead
You've got champagne eyes when you're handing out lies
Now there's a letter open
Too many times I
You've got me way too high
Oooooh ahhhhhhh
Your deed don't cut they're just decoration
Been here a thousand times
Well I turn around, I'm knocked down
Woke up this morning with a splinter in my head
Too high, too high
I'll do it every time
We're alright now, we're alright now
Look in the mirror while I fumble for the key
I don't mind now, yea alright now
Put in a corner with the sharks and the fiends
Every time I go down I end up instead
