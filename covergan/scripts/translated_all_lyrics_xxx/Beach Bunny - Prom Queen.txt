If I'm pretty, will you like me?
Shut up, count your calories
You should lower your beauty standards
I never look good in mom jeans
Maybe I should try harder
Teach me how to be okay
It's getting hard to breathe
If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?
Wish I was like you
They say beauty is pain
If you look a certain way
You should lower your expectations
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
They say beauty makes boys happy
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks
I've been starving myself, carving
Skin until my bones are showing
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body
I wanna be okay
I don't want to downplay my emotions
You'll only be happy
Dissect my insecurities
I was never cut out for Prom Queen
I'm a defect surgical project
