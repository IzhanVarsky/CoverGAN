If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
It's not hard for us to say what we should not
With our eyes shielding from the oncoming counts
Oooooh ooooooh oooooh
Let me come closer, i'm not your shadow
Touch me i'm cold, unable to control
And tumbling tumbling, don't go fascination
Touch me i'm golden and wild as the wind blows
Let's get lost
