There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Living out on a prayer
Night is crawling up to the day
With you, with you
Wanna stay up all night with you
Right into the rhythm now
Oh, keep on moving
Hands up in the air
If you don't really care
Now get yourself together
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Wanna get my body loose
I been jumping through some hoops
I just wanna stay up all night
I hear the noise ringing
Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Now I'm feeling so far away
When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go
Just wanna stay up all night with you
When they break it down and this world is all you know
If you got the time to take it up there
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
Looking for a diamond
Don't wait for nothing now
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do
Let them know that you're there
The sirens all singing
Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)
With you, you
Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now
Up all night with you
I been running out of bounds like an animal struggling
One, two, what you doing?
Keep on moving
Put it up in the air
