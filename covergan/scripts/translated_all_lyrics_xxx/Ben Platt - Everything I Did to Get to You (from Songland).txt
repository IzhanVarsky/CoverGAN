You don't try to fix me
You see the world that I see
On the road to where we are
‘Til it pointed me to you
Been the life of the party
Done the worst I could do
Reached the end
Just held me back
Tried to change the old me
Everything I did for you
I'd do it all again
I’d do it all again
I've been bruised and burned
Everything I did to get to you (Everything, everything)
Changin’ almost broke me
Somewhere in the city
Whoohoo, oooh (Everything, everything)
I think I might've lost me
Just to fight the lonely
Settled for somebody
I'll admit the fact that I
But somehow I'm intact
I did for you
All the hearts I ever held
Everything I did to get to you, ooh (Everything, everything)
I’ve been bruised and burned
Put myself out on the line
But you saw me from the start
All the times I thought I might've
All the times I thought I might’ve
Chasin' love that was pointless
But somehow I’m intact
