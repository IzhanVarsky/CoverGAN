Go on friend
Did you wonder how it went?
Remember you’re okay
It’s gonna come around the bend
The majority, they just stress while looking down their phones
Did you close your eyes? Did you close your eyes?
You’re just lost and worried (Just lose and worried)
You must try to find yourself
Its gonna come around the bend
When all I needed was your hand
Society, I don’t understand your goals
It’s gonna come around again (Come around again)
I wonder why we feel alone?
Embrace the darkness (Embrace the darkness)
In this time of waking
Do you remember how I felt?
Anxiety, it’s just making me go low
But don’t hide, theres no shame (No shame)
Cause when I asked you where you went
I couldn’t find you, but then I found you, you were next to me all the time
When you sing it goes away (Sing it goes away)
I try to handle it, its just never stops taking its toll on me
With your spiral thinking
