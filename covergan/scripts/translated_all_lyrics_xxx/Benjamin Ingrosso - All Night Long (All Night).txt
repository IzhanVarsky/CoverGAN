All night long (All night, all night) (Oh, no)
We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Let the music take control
Lose yourself in wild romance
All night long (All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(All nigh-, all night, all nigh-, all night)
Feel it in your heart
See the rhythm in their feet, yeah
All night long
All night long (All night, all night)
Come on and sing along, yeah
Life is good, wild and sweet
All night long (All night, all night) (All night)
People dancing all in the street
Yeah, all night long (All night, all night)
(All night, all night, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everyone's dancing their troubles away
Let the music play on
Come join our party and see how we play
(All nigh-, all night)
Throw away the work to be done
All night long, all night long
And feel it in your soul
To raise the roof and have some fun
All night long (All night, all night) (Yeah, yeah)
Come on and sing along
Well, my friends, the time has come
Everybody sing, and everybody dance
