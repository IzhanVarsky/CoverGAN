You are on your surfboard thinkin' life is so good
(Babe, you are lying to everyone)
('Cause you got a new region everyday)
I want to go to Costa Rica
You think you live the Pura Vida
You fucking love la Costa Rica (Lalalalala, lala)
Saying you love being on your own
Brrua
If you only can grow up, you'll wake up and see
Yeah
You know
(Saying you love being on your own)
All of your friends telling you to stay
You fucking love la Costa Rica
But it makes you forget the real ya
Girl, you need to find yourself, but that place even helped?
It's a dream, it ain't real, you don't care 'bout how I feel
So I can bring back my Linnea
Babe, you are lying to everyone
Spendin' the days drinking tequila (Lalalalala, lala)
'Cause it makes you forget the real ya
But it makes you forget the real ya (Lalalalala, lala)
Spendin' the days drinking tequila
'Cause you lonely, ooh
I'm in London waiting for a phone call from you
(All of your friends telling you to stay)
Life is so much more than spending nights on the beach
You can see nothin' else, only you and yourself
'Cause you got a new region everyday
