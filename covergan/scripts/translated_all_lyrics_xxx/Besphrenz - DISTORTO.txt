Take another shot I know I shouldn't
Packin' up and leavin' in the mornin'
Ain't even know me if it ain't business
Duh-huh duh-duh
Shit, what did I get into, yeah?
Man they ain't listening
Guess I got it twisted or something
Like ain't showing love if they ain't listed
Shit I'm looking for something that ain't listed
Day trippin'
A listing
I got lost with you
Dooh-ooh doo-doo, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Feelin' like a couple though
Can you open up a window, yeah?
It's a, different night same story
Don't know why I do, the shit I do, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
When you say it I ignore it, I ignore it
I don't wanna be the one to say it
Wake up in my jeans and in my hoodie
Playin' a game like an addiction
But this shit's a little overrated
I think I'm so high
Sayin' things when it ain't important (Woo-ooh-ooh)
Brain insane anyway it's way different
