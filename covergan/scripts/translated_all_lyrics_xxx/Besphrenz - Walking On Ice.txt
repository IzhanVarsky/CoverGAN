I just gotta find the right way (the right way)
Got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
Now we got the people seemin' like the devils in church
Don't just act like you forgot to (you forgot)
You got me walkin' on ice
My way (my way), yuh, hey
Yeah, let me know when you're around my way, yeah (aye, yuh)
You know who I'm talkin' to
Aye, yeah this one's for you (for you, for you)
Drop a pin like this where I stay (me)
You've got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
I got somethin' that I might say (that I might say)
Drop a pin like where you at (like where you at, yuh)
Yeah, thought you was the one, I forgot too ()
I'm just tryna get you back, aye (back, yuh)
Darlin' I'm fallin, fallin' for you
I just gotta do it my way (my way)
Oh, you brought your own, I got a lot, too (you know that)
We can go pound for pound, yeah
Pour a couple more and see who stops who
You got me
Darlin' I'm fallin', fallin' for you
It's a draw, who's gonna pull first?
You got me walkin' on ice, yeah, slippin' and fallin'
And you got the people screamin' like the devils in church
We was lit, but now you not you (no, no, no)
