And we can't unlearn what we've learned
I’m sure we’ll awake
And we can't unhear what we've heard
‘Cause all our love is instant history
We try to position our lives on a string
But the history’s a nightmare
Why do I fear it?
To any time or place
We could go
This is the sound that we make
Releasing the pressure
Is this how
The horrors that await
Adjust my dreams for me
I got a fever in my bones
Dear God
We only exist in the noise that we bring
I love the sound when it breaks
And now I’m losing all control
Gets me so high that I can taste it
Can you hear it?
We’re shouting in the streets
All I learned is instant history
The surface will break?
Its only real if you can’t replace it
Hell hath no fury like a human born
