We have achieved so much more
You stink of hallelujah
Now it is my turn
How’s it gonna feel when you’re standing there alone?
Take me and my worth
We live in a kingdom of blood
But you wash yourself in sin
This indelible creature
Justify your reasons
This is true obsession
When you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
Subtle as a steam burn
Well have you seen her?
We are the wolves of winter
Your fits of paranoia
Than you possibly thought we could
Just remember, no "I" in team
You can achieve anything
How’s it gonna feel when there’s no one to support ya?
This is the point we have the choice to survive the winter
There’s two in brilliant
This heavenly creature
Love that you’re seething
You are no exception
This is the point we have the choice to be happy together
Record this?!
When you gonna try to boil my last bone?
There are no reruns
Drive your every whim
More than just a scald
We are the wolves!
