I think I like it this way
Going all the way up
My tongue and my taste
My head is unscrewed
Yeah
’Cause I'm going out of my mind
Never coming back down
I gotta make a clean break
Never coming back
What do I need it for?
Oh-ah (Yeah)
You and me
Can't see them anymore
Headed for a new space
My eyes are out of view
Coming unglued, ah
X, Y, Z
These are things that go together now
Can't see it anyway
They don’t know what to say
I'll go higher with you
That my body is about to blow
Here I come
Everything feels so unfamiliar
I just wanna let you know
One, two, three
Must be going out of my mind
I know what to do
The look on her face
Leaving it all behind
