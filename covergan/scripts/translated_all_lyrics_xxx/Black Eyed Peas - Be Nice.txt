But I do not want negative energy
We should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
Be different, be nice
The love you give is the love you get
I don't wanna be in depression
If we could all just find a way to fly away
And when we talk, be nice to each other
Stay in your bag
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
I just wanna be cool, live my life without the problems
One step, so deft, so right, go left
Be cordial, be glad, be happy, not sad
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life
I'm talking to myself in the mirror
To slip into a brighter day (Say what?)
And do it to 'em right away
And all of my banger that bang with they flag
Hey, be different, be nice
Be hood to each other in the house-a, mi casa su casa
I got a new direction
I don't wanna feel nasty
I just wanna be happy
But I ain't living life in the bottom
And it's so cold like Siberia
On and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on, rollin' on
So be nice and change your life
I'm tryna turn my vibration around so I can feel fantastic
I don't wanna carry no bad vibration
Be nice (Hey)
Be nice
Everyone around got tears of a clown
Be nice, be nice
Whether Crip or Blood, be good to each other
I ain't got no time for stressin'
I'm telling me to, telling me to cheer up
'Cause I do not want negative energy
I'm talking to all of my leaders
Everybody tryna push me down to the ground
And fight for each other, not one another
If you get what you give, give me positivity (Give it to me, hey)
