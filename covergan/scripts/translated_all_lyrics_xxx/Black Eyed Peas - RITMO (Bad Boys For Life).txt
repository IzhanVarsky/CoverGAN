(oh yeah)
(This is the rhythm of the night)
I do not deny it to you because I know what there is (Wuh)
I'm going for a legend so give it zumba
Born to be wild 'cause I live like a daredevil
Baby, tonight's like fire (Of the night)
We party to the end, end, end, end, end
Without a stylist I look fly (Yes)
You know how we do it, baby
We 'bout to spend the money (Oh, yeah)
Live it up, hit 'em up, that's the scenario (Pac)
As Canelo in the ring nothing scares me
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
Hakuna Matata as Timon and Pumbaa
I am on top of the pedestal (Flu shot)
No stop, keepin' it movin's the narrative
La Rosalía tells me I look cool (La Rosalía)
The rhythm, the rebels, styles upon styles upon styles, I got several
I get around like a merry go (Rooftop)
What is seen, is not asked (Na ')
We'll be back the next day (Oh, yeah)
Won't stop, don't need to speak to no therapist
I learned that shit down in Mexico (Hahaha!)
Nonstop, do it like woo, there it is
I am so sick I need medical (Puta)
I am prosperous and I am clear that it is my fault (It is my fault, fault; ah)
That's how we do it, we buildin' like LEGOs (Oh, yeah)
Can't stop, I am addicted I never quit
Haters for the tomb, we for the rumba (Ra)
I leave them blind' with the vibe that enlightens me
You like that space?
We party to the extreme, baby
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
Feel on the fire, you dealin' with fire
I live in my base and peace is not knocked down (Wuh)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
They are neither Reebok nor Nike (No)
Rhythm
We break all night (Of the night)
The rhythm, the rebel, new and improved I be on a new level
