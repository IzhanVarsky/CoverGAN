I'm tied down to this chain
To find holy embrace
Hold onto me, and I can't let go
And live with my mistakes
With a scarlet cross
Sin for me, cast away from it all
It spirals as I ache
Cannot be free and you can't deny
It's how they see you break
Blackened and left in control
With the fear and the cost
The fear and the cost
Will we live? Whеn we die?
The end is coming, thе end is coming
Stay with me, I'm afraid of my soul
A symbol for my shame
Watching every letter fall
The end is coming, the end is coming
Will we live? When we die?
The world will stain us with a scarlet cross
The color of your name
My mind remains my pain
Just keep on saving our goodbyes
