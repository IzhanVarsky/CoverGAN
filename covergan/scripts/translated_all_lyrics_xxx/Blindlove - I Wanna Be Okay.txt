Just wanna be okay
And right now I'm needing to make a new change
I wanna be okay
And I know that it's never easy to hear your name
And is the sky still blue?
I'm searching for sounds and for anything new
I'm anchored in doubt
I wanna bе okay
I know I'll never be the same
Been pacing a line from the sink to the couch
Just wanna bе okay
And it's never easy to hear your name
Just something you can't contain
Have you seen the sun today?
I'm scared to go out today
And I know I'll never be the same
See life through a windowpane
