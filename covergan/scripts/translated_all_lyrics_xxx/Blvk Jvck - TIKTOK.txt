Headbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
We got 'em sinking, they thinking, they rockstars
She hit the drink and she got loved the way, she popping lot
Drugs got 'em faded, these bitches got locked jaws
Drip drop, I just blew it on a wrist watch
Hеadbanger, let her fuck me to some Slipknot
She say she wanna have some fun, it's hard to find now
Allstar, you fucking with allstar
Let's rewind that
She not that famous but she blowing up on Tik Tok
She not that famous but she blowing up on TikTok
All my buddies came with, I got BLVK JVCK
R-R-Riot at the sauce, boy, Steven
Ey, all my buddies came with me, now where the dimes at?
Buddies came with me, now where they dimes at?
She hit the drink and she got loved thе way, she popping lot
You acting shitty, I can't tell if you are up or not
Big bucks
Like billboard, I been fucking with the big bucks
They pull up solo but left in a cop car
See you hating, you can meet me at the tip top
W-Why you playing? I'm just tryna get behind that
