In my world, only you
But they may never find what they dream of
I guess you wonder where I've been
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
Got a thing for you and I can't let go
Some people go around the world for love
What you won't do, do for love
I searched to find a love within
And though I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you
You've tried everything, but you don't give up
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Make me do for love what I would not do
I came back to let you know
You've tried everything, but you won't give up
