Oh and I have carried consecration
(It might be over soon)
(It might be over soon, two two)
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
And if it's ever gonna happen
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
Within a rise there lies a scission
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
As I may stand up with a vision
So I can speak into the silence
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon
There I find you marked in constellation (two, two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
(It might be over soon) two, two
And then You expelled all decision
And then I draw an ear on you
Caught daylight, goddamn right
(All these years)
