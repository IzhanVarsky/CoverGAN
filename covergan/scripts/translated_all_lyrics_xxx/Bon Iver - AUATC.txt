Well, you know the burden ain't a gust
Help is surely on its way
Don't bask in the glory of mine
Lay down, Martha
You know that truth's been known to crutch
You are the only way to trust ya
If you can see your own kite (Shed a little light, oh Lord)
Man, your neighbors don't know
Lay down the holy banner flag
Well, you're up all night
You know a burden ain't a bust
They were always on the take (Will you shed a little light, oh Lord)
And it's up to me if I don't wear a mask
No no no
And your head's down low
It's only fair it burns up in that rust
They ate up all their cake
But oh no, they can't come take that part away
(So shed a little light, oh Lord)
Only them whose pauper lays him up
And your neighbors don't know
I don't bask in the glory
Oh no (nah nah)
There's no master and
And they drank their own wine
Hold out, Martha
I don't ask
Help will surely come around
Well you're up all night
Lay all that alabaster down
I'll always know that all that proper mounts too much
The only path to love is touch
And it's not right
