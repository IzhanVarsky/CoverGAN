I was tremendously scared
I'm the only one
The sky that spreads infinitely
No matter how many times you stumble, you will be there
Look at the white sky and carve it here
You can cry
What to throw away to get there
Even if you scream over and over again
Whether fictitious or real
Filled with signs of dawn
Brian the Sun Lyrics for "Heroes"
I woke up with a dream of moving away no matter how many times I approached
Someday all of them will be flowers
I'm a tiny person, but I'm still looking for an indelible light
laughing
I'm shaking, I'm looking for the meaning of existence in the dark
I'm sure I can go beyond
The dull me and the world that surrounds me
Even if I draw or grab it, it's still far away
You can fall
The city is hiding its voice
I can run without a map
You can reach it no matter how far you are
