Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
Hold my breath and let it bury me
('Cause you know that I can't do this on my)
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
I'm not okay and it's not alright
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Who will fix me now?
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
