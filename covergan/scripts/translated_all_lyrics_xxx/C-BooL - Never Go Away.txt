In the glow of starry sky seven nights I would lie
I will never go away
I just wanna show you how to stay
Listen and you'll never go away (Go away)
I will never go away-ay-ay
Hey, if you ever want to leave it all
Maybe then you'll think it is okay
But I'll tell you how I see it now
In the moonlight hear the song
If you ever want to lose control
Now I know wanna stay
And still listen all night long
Leave it all escape so far away
Listen and you'll never go away
Stay stay stay stay
Now I know I wanna stay, I will never go away
Take the guitar and I'll tell you how
Listen and you'll never go away (Go away, go away)
