Touch the fear of fire
You hold the wings of a wild-born dove
You thread the needle sky
To make the old time pay
Tattered throne and a broken crown
x
To pass the night away
I'm a red star lately
Through the dark all night
Ride alone in the rain my love
Through the red door faintly
To see the only star
I hold the beams of rider's sun
