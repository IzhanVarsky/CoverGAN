By the side of the road
Not a meter of headway
Take me to heaven with the money I'm owed
You know I'm only towing the line
I'm running on water
Before I can repay
I'm buried in lost time
Now I feel I'm falling behind
Brother, know where I'll be
You can be the starlight in my constellation
I didn't have to justify my invitation
Talk to me, are we river swimming? Saint Marie
When your momma can't take the heat
When you just can't find your feet
I'm sat on the runway
All of my money is for running away
(Just can't find your feelings)
Even the dawn is getting sick of the day
Lately, it's a matter of time
Talk to me (just can't find your feelings)
I did a lot to justify my invitation
Even the sun is getting sick of the day
I need a replay
I'm chasing a goldmine
I'm a shadow on the sea
I did a lot to crucify your reputation
Are we river swimming? Saint Marie
