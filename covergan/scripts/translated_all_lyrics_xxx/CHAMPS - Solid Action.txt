I’m falling through the floors again
And it’s killing my heart again
All your intuition, your ill-placed fears
x
So you can shoot to the top on solid action
Do you feel let down?
Your five fingers are picking up dust again
I’m fading through light again
All your demons and solid ideas
I’m picking up stars again
Are you missing, or picking up dust again
A solid action
All the dreams you made at high tide
All your papers are picking up dust again
And in the blink of a solid action
So call me buddy
On the cold ocean of sweat you had
All the roses and all your ideas
All your desolation and coloured tears
And it’s a short, sharp hit
Are you at the station with your tombstone bell
But don’t call me friend
On the beach side, or in your hotel
Then I can rush to the top of solid action
