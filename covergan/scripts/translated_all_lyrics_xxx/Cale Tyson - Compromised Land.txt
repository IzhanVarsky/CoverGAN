Give 'em a hand, give 'em a hand
It's as if we exist in some compromised land
You can laugh or you can cry but never can't comply
It's the only thing to do when they take the right to choose
Re-set all the madness we've started to let in
I'll confess that I've spent years writing songs for cheers
Take my hand, take my hand
About love that might have gone wrong or a sad country song
And he fills people with fear of the people who aren't from here
We must stand, we must stand
It's one-side escape, either way leads
The devil is in disguise and he's dealing out the dangers
Give a hand, give a hand
No it can't, no it can't
Make a stand, make a stand
Is it fear disguised as power? Could it take the upper hand?
Take a stand, take a stand
But there's something on my mind and it's cruel to act so blind
Hang me up for the say it isn't true
Where the rich don't supply and the poor drown
How the hell can you for a TV star to
To the girl, removing her heart with a coat-hanger
Let's turn off the world turn it off again
You can color me the flag, paint me red white and sad
As he screams at the top of his thumbs and he fires this thoughts like a gun
