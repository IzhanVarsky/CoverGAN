Wrestle my foolish head
Swear I could just disappear
Guess that makes twenty-one
Never can win
But after you'll check on my Instagram
And I'll be old
And prove that you're fine
Crying on the kitchen floor
She’ll convince you you're over this
And I wonder if that'd be the case for you
Don’t tiptoe around in my fragile mind
But I make it
You know all I've got is time
Maybe it's not healthy anymore
And you're sittin' on my couch
Pick up your feet when you walk away
As much as I try
And prob’ly be right
There's twenty mosquitos in my house
Don't be a drag and say
So you could find someone new
It’s just not healthy anymore
"Might be a chance"
We don't have to start a war
They never remember my order here
Reach out for the upper hand
It’d all be the same
Your love, I cannot outrun
And I sit here while you’re at the therapist
And sit all alone
And I'm sorry but sometimes you seem like one
Where people all dress the same
Too, too much time
In the morning I fight my way out of bed
Fate, it knocks upon my door
Down to that hip cafe
