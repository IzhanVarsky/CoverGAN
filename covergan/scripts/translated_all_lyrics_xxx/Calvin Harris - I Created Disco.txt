How you began creating disco
I created disco
With the assistance of Mary, my wife
I, I actually developed during the war
By using a succession of techniques
And I, I was conducting various sonic experiments
Would you just like to tell us
Anyway during one session I discovered that
Well it was the mid 's
I could create an entirely new genre of music
How you began creating
Disco, disco, disco, disco, disco
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And that was the night I created disco
