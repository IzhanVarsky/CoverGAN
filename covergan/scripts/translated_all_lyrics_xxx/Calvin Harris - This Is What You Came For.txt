Baby, this is what you came for
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
We go fast with the game we play (Game we play, game we play)
But she's lookin' at
I say, "Your place" when we leave
Who knows why it's gotta be this way (Be this way, be this way)
We say nothin' more than we need (Than we need, than we need)
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Yeah
And everybody's watchin' her
