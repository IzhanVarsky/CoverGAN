Within that breaking home
Was breaking that break up home
You have to help apologise for the sake of future days
Was rolling up, break the wall
You better have nothing for me, you better move year on your face
Is all you're gonna do all
And the tall wind did break your home, roll, roll on
I'm coming home and away you go
You're spreading that lie, you know that
All you're gonna do for all that you do
I just think that room's to end, how commend them from your dreams?
When doing that was breaking home
To the all and all you go
And when I'm coming home tonight
What have you done, free the night?
For the sake of future days, for the sake of future days
Save that money for a rainy day for the sake of future days
You're getting down, breaking your neck
For the sake of future days, said it's all for the sake of future days
And the night you're losing, light down from your dreams
Do you think you can do, the people away to do it all?
