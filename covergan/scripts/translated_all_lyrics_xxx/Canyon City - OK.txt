Leaving nothing much behind
Hang, lingering and fade
Stays long, till it’s late and the colors we become
It couldn’t be what I couldn’t have
There’s so many days but none they made you for
When you’d float through the door
Hang, lingering and fade, in some time it comes back up
Though the nights are long, there’s peace you’re walking towards and
When your love slipped in
Now they’re filled to the brim
No matter what I had before
Say, it’s been some day, and we’re finally in the sun
I used to want a little more
I used to think I would die here alone, oh what a lie
A few guitars, a couple lines
And you’re finally in the sun
I used to think I would die
Say, it’s been some day, laying out here when the sun
But I don’t need those empty hands
It's so bright now that you've come
Hey, I’m not ok, but I’m better than I was
I couldn’t close them anymore
A white light opened my eyes
Here alone and I was fine
If you ever feel like nothing here is yours
A broken heart, white lies
In some time it comes back up
Never enough and never sure
No moments ever coming back
Stay, long till it’s late and the colors we become
I can promise you there’s sunrises in store
Give it time, it comes back up
