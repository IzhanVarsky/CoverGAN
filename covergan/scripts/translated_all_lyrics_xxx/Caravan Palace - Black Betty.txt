The damn thing gone blind (Bam-ba-Lam)
The damn thing gone wild (Bam-ba-Lam)
Well, she's shakin' that thing (Bam-ba-Lam)
She really gets me high (Bam-ba-Lam)
She's from Birmingham (Bam-ba-Lam)
She's so rock steady (Bam-ba-Lam)
You know that's no lie (Bam-ba-Lam)
And she's always ready (Bam-ba-Lam)
Way down in Alabam' (Bam-ba-Lam)
Whoa, Black Betty (Bam-ba-Lam)
She said, "I'm worryin' outta mind" (Bam-ba-Lam)
Back from Birmingham (Bam-ba-Lam)
Black Betty had a child (Bam-ba-Lam)
Boy, she makes me sing (Bam-ba-Lam)
