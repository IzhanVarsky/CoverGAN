'Cause she's happy on her own
And she picks up all the pieces
'Til she did it on her own
She's better off than she has ever been
There's so much she can teach me
Home, home
Yeah, she's going home
It all seemed so easy
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Now she's made her peace with everything
Baby, I'm home
She's going home
She just does what she pleases
