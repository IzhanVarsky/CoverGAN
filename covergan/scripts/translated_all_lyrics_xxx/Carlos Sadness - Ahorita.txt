In your skin it never dawned
speed is relative
I want to see you when I wake up
You're always telling me right now
But it seems eternal to me...
I waited for you until the end of the day
You ask me for a little more time
A moment for the universe
Uuh, uh-uh
I'm here right now
I'm coming right now
Right now I'm going, right now I'm going
Daisies grew in my hair
I'm coming right now (I'm coming right now)
you would come to stop the time
you love me but slowly
But you arrive when I'm already asleep
And if you were a little slower
It must be that you are never in a hurry
And I'm going, right now I'm going
I will change the rhythm for you
I'm going, I'm going now
