So that it looks cool
I know I'm not alone
That you are not alone, o-ooh (Ouh-oh)
Anyone there?
I don't feel alone now, o-o-ooh (Ouh-oh)
Sun that shines in the morning
I blow you some clouds that cover you
For all
That's why I say aloha, a-a-aah
So that the world is softer
If you want I'll stay with you
I don't know where I'm going but I'm going with you
I hug you, I dance for you and I take care of you
Stereo bomb in a cool way
those who once
From Barcelona to Santa Marta
They felt alone
Although you think that right now it is not necessary
I don't know where I'm going but with you I'll go
you are already here
If my gaze does not reach your eyes
Aloha, a-a-aah
And I bring you the color that you need
Pa' that you look in a cool way
This is a message
Hello
From the other side of the galaxy
I bring you straight to the beach
You want to come?
Can you hear me?
(Me'!)
And when the waves move
I bring you a ray of hope
Just in case, I want to tell you...
