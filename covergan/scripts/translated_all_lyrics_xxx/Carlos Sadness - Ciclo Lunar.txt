that you talk to the stars
everything is so spatial
You say I don't fit in with you or your moon sign
I didn't believe in that shit
You come to look for me, you come to look for me with your lunar cycle-ar (Let's go)
you wanted to read my hands
You come to look for me, you come to look for me with your lunar cycle-ar
You say I don't fit in with you or your moon sign (Your sign)
To see if a message in the sky is for me (It's for me)
You say you don't make it up
Which is very fire sign
And that is not what I expect
You only look for me if the Moon is in the middle (If it is in the middle)
But baby you're always right
To see if a message in heaven is for me
I see you repeated in the same instant
They want to see us apart
With your lunar cycle
You only look for me if the moon is in the middle
And I stay to sleep in your giant eyelashes
And they said that the stars
To go with you in your astral travels
In case I put something wrong
You say I daydream
That you have already seen the future
And if I look at you through a diamond
You say I don't fit with you or your lunar cycle
And... now I spend the nights without being able to sleep
