I'm so small that I fit in a dream
Lost on the brunette island (Oh, oh, oh)
oh brunette
where you are
Sometimes I think of you so loud I think you can hear me over there
You can't imagine how good the dark suits you
Let's laugh at the bad weather
where are you the center of gravity
to give me a kiss
There is an island in the middle of the sea
Putting your ear on a shell you take me from Barcelona
And the air is ours, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take me (why don't you take me?)
And my bones tremble?
With palm trees and monkeys that know how to talk
Take me (Take-take me)
And they tell you... secrets
In the flowers that grow in your hair (Yeah-yeah, woah)
until you touch your teeth
Where the most tropical fruit grows
In the flowers that grow in your hair (Oh, oh, oh)
The one that tastes like... your kisses
Because there is an island in the middle of the sea where the most tropical fruit grows
Lost on the brown island
Because there is an island in the middle of the sea
What do you have when you stop
You're going to take a shower and I already miss you
Let's die of laughter
And the air is ours (Let's go)
If you want we can come
where you say that there is no time
Brunette, take me right now (Oh, oh, take me)
In a bit
Brunette, take me (why don't you take me?)
Why don't you take me to one of those places?
Oh, oh, oh, little brunette
