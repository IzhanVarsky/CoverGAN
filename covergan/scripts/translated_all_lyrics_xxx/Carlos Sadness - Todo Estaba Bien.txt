Even if you only drink tea
Although it was very cold on the tips of your feet
That never repeats, constantly changes (No)
As if you never did (As if you never did)
I like it when you make me coffee
We surf in bed at all hours
I stay dreaming, with you
We see the sea together through the window
I like it when we go to the beach
when you wanted to see me
I like it when you made me coffee (You made coffee)
When everything was alright-eh-eh-eh-en (When everything was alright)
Where no one returns and we were fleeting (Yes, yes)
and start to know each other
But I never see it (But I never see it)
Although it was very cold on the tips of your feet (Yeah)
Cause all your kisses are a different color
When everything was fine (So fine)
And we stayed up all night
In the midst of the noise, among so many people
Back to the first time I had you in front of me
Like you never got around to it
and stay to live
When everything was fine, when you wanted to see me
I like it when we go to the beach (To the beach)
We measure the size of the waves
I miss making out with you all night
And how good it would be to meet again
How nice it would be to return
Every day there is a sunrise
Whatever time it was, it was to not return
The first word you dedicated to me
