Ain't no way to say no
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (It's hard to breathe)
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (Gasoline, gasoline)
Fire (yeah)
Don't let any air in
Wearing what your wearing
Chemically our chemicals are dangerously beautiful
There's no end to you and me
Why do I come when you call?
You got my attention
We don't even get along, oh, nah
Turning up the heat again, oh, nah
With, with gasoline
With gasoline
And when we got so close, it's hard to breathe
Turning up the heat again
Caught up in the tension
Don't open the windows
Fire with gasoline
I know that we shouldn't start
Fire
Crash into me like a car
Don't need innuendos
Hit me with adrenaline, yeah
Hit me with adrenaline
It's hard to breathe
And when we get so close, it's hard to breathe
Oh, no
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
Oh, right
