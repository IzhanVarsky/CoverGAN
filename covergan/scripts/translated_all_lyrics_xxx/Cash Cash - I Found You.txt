And I can say lookin' in your eyes
I found pessimism, I found skepticism
Gone along for a wild ride
I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions
It all would have been a waste
On the way I was given the keys
On the way I was crowned a king
Played the fool and the star of the show
To the city they were mine to keep
It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way
I found you, I found you
But you love me all the same
That it all would've been a waste
I've been the zero, the hero
And I have been the villain
I lost more than a heart can take
I've been high and I've been low
I found you on the way
I found cynicism, I found criticism
Felt the wind underneath my wings
Over time every lock'll change
