Fuck you, oh-oh
I ain't no activist, I'm the protagonist
I know the devil's a liar
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
And I can't do nothing right, they gon' always be at me
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish
Speaking of racist, fuck your microaggressions
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter
Fuck you
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job
The Illuminati couldn't see me with they good eye
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (No)
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (Nah-nah)
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu, fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu
I mean my G in the head
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fuck you-ou-ou-ou
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, oh
So I just hire a sitter
My enemy lives in his mother's basement
The Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?
I missed a Crain's interview, they tried leaking my addy
I'm a real one
The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter
I'm the real deal
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (Yep)
Fuck you, fuck you
Boy meets world, everybody been savages
I don't get no paper, I gotta sign at the bottom
And Rahm, you done, I'm expectin' resignation
Still in my bag like the fries at the bottom
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die
An open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers
I'm not no nice guy, I'm just the good guy
I was younger than I seemed as a kid
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols
Fuck you, fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
I don't co-captain it, I fly solo like one cup in the cabinet
I just want to really know how much that your shooter averages
The bad guys should really stay on my good side
Inherited the earth, popping wheelies on a big wheel
I mean I'm only but I'm Motown
I smelled my roses younger than the good die
Kingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya
