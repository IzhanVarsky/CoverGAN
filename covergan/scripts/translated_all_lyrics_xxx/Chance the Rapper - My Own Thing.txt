Gon' raise yo' money, won't raise yo' kids? (What?)
Please don't hit me in my DM
How you gon' raise yo' voice?
I decided that I gotta do my own thing
Take her to the culprit then I take her to the store (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do my own thing
She say she like how the car stop, but the rims don’t
If you work in my space, better keep that shit 'fessional
Do my own thing, yeah
I know she gonna see 'em 'cause I'm defa finna show her
When I go and travel, I might have to take her with
Promise that my BM gonna slide when she see 'em
She just like my personal space, got a circular waist
Just let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring
Okay, don't mind if it don't pay me, it ain't my biz
Please leave me the fuck alone, new fiancée, that's my cologne
I don't like to be bothered when I work, work, work, work
My new girl a freak, she my type, she unique
I'ma do my own thing
Tell my ex it's a dub, that's a wop, that's unlikely
Bad little bitty in the city that I'm in (Yeah)
Make her sang when we bang, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet
I was with a ' (Yup) sellin' s
Now I'm , sellin' s (Yup), it's a hunnid ways
Yeah, yeah, I just gotta do my own thing
Doin' too much and sayin' too much, that's how y'all ass end up alone
I'ma just pimp off, you a send-off, I don't really ever like to get involved
I'm finna buy a ringtone, then let the phone ring
Pull my shirt when she work, work, work, work, work
Put a bustdown on my wifey, like Gucci Mane, so icy
Got a baby, got a house, got in-laws, go and kick rocks
Ain't wanna leave but I had to go, like Trey Songz
