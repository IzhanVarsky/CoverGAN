What's the point of gainin' chicken if it can't get across?
Photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
I'm tryna back up my baby mama like Kevin Federline
Tryna eat everything
Never leave where I came from
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
He never ring
Please, man, we needin' some freeze pops
Tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
Don't teach him 'bout Santa 'til you teach him 'bout Jesus
Don't take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
That baby is a genius
Real talk, I need a front yard, a backyard
Tell Santa to show up to doors he never ring
Well, we'll keep the elevator
That shit be see-through like John Cena, Aquafina
It's been a minute since I've seen her
What to get the man who has everything?
I said, "I'll take anything but everything," you know?
Look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
I guess I cleaned up, Santa don't miss no names but I miss Fatimah
I was raised, it come across my plate, then I better swing
A side yard, a side yard, inside bar, a dry bar
Like my papa ask the same question every year
That's all I ask
And the chimney they could hang from
What in the world for the man who has everything?
That shit could get sticky like tree sap
Christmas cards so gorgeous, other families wanna frame one
What's the point of gainin' chicken if you lose all the sauce?
Lost the cold hard cash, they said, "Damn, that boy soft"
I just need me some stockings
Man, West Chatham Park could use some better swings
Nine cars and a garage, and it's on hella acres
But like the Christmas tape, there's things that I gotta get clear
Stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
Heard they got some nice-ass houses out there in Beverly
I gave you free raps, that shit sound like free facts
Used to be disheveled, I went and shoveled everything
I'm tired of people visitin', takin' the elevator
And once the debris drops, the streets degrees hot
"What to get for my boy who has everything?"
Same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin' coin toss
I swear, it's enough leisure in this world to get lost
Them the type of things I hate to bring up, just like the prenup
Which is 'bout as common as free blacks
Tryna turn Confederate flags into confetti strings
Don't gifts get re-wrapped?
