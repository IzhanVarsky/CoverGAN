All that's new and true and gay
Finding meaning while we're dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Smiling faces, going places
Our destiny is Heaven-sent
Talking in the glow of love
(Here in glow of love) I gotta let you know you move me, yeah
(I'm yours forever and a day) We are a sweet bouquet
It's a wonder, it's so clear
That special magic from above
Time will always be our friend
Ooh, ooh
Make it known, this loving tone
Easy living when we're given
(There is no better way to be) Honey, I, love you
Summer, spring, winter, and fall
(I'm yours forever and a day) We are a sweet bouquet, hey, hey
Walking, ooh, whoa-ho-oh, whoa
We will always reminisce, kissing in the glow of love
What we know we're dreaming of
Sipping wine, we try to find
Laughing, dancing 'til the dawn
Reaching far to find a star
Easy living and we're given
Of the splendor of it all
As we share our affair
(Here in glow of love) You're a shining star
In the glow of love
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we're in rapture in the glow)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are one having fun
(Here in glow of love) Gotta let you know you move me, yeah
By a fountain, climbing mountains
And the beauty seems to say
(Here in glow of love) So I wanna let you know you move me
Never lonely, with you only
(Here in glow of love) You really, really do, yeah
(Here in glow of love) No matter who you are
Of love
Flowers blooming, morning dew
Will never part the two of us
(Seasons for happiness are here) Happy, we're so happy, yeah
And we'll always be like this glowing in the glow of love
It's a pleasure when you treasure
(There is no better way to be) Hold me, caress me
As we hold each other near
Walking in the glow of love, yeah
Walking in the glow of love
(Seasons for happiness are here) Can you feel it all around you?
All the people meeting people
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh yeah
We're surrounded and abounded
(Here in glow of love) Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, ooh-ooh
(Here in glow of love) Yeah, yeah
