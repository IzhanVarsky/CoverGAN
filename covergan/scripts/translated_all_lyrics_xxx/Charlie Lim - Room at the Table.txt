But you’re never really lost
How easy we forget
Where our differences make us whole
But all of my worries
Every lesson learned
And everything must change”
If all that we are
When you’re never alone
And water from the well
There’s always room at the table
Begin to lose their weight
To listen is to love
And I know
I’ll be living for the day
Can we afford to be kinder
How many times
No, nothing's ever perfect
Give new strength for us to hope
When I hold you near
That everything takes time
May the stories that bind us
When each word can’t be a blessing
But I still call you mine
To others and ourselves?
A house doesn’t make a home
Then I know I gotta be
And all of my fears
Have you heard them say:
“The future is uncertain
The change I wanna see
Through all the years
Is what we believe
