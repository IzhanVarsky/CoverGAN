Never stop moving, so I don't gotta deal with it
The empty concept of success
I guess it's just the human condition
Take it all as I go
Noise all around, ain't no quiet, I hear buzzing
I beg for something that I'll never taste
We all got a hunger that isn't tameable
And hollow at best, that's when I'm going off to reflect
Because the fame is an illusion, the money ain't a solution
What really matters, the laughter, I should be hedging my bets
And numb out the sounds that been in my ears, drumming
Whether losing or winning
Just like you, and shit I got my insecurities too
Well this as raw as it gets
I'll pray tomorrow
Y'all see me as the person that I choose you to view
But I've been all in
I'm full of nothing with a grin on my face
Shit, we can't even define it, but still we fiending for it, never the less
And see it all like
I just really need a spaceship like that old Kanye shit
I'm full of nothing
But as I'm caught in the stress, feeling lost in the mess
Through it all, I keep my chin up, acknowledge I'm blessed
Feel like we need it to achieve it, shit we tend to forget
Or make a makeshift airplane and take trips
I'll pray tomorrow but I'm sinning today
It's hard to be a motherfucking human
And causes fright until the fucking jaws of life
I channel 'em and work through it when I'm on the mic
No absolution, what I've learned in conclusion
When I get wounded, I never get to healing it
Chasing after the rush of it, trying to feel something
Change, erase this pain my frame's encased with
It's proven, but still we addicted to the dilution
The inner voice struggles from a loss of sight
We just keep on chasing something until it's skewing our vision
Life been weighing heavy and I'm feeling it
I beg for something
Hard to be a homie when they see you like a meal ticket
But it's the fans that keep me going, yo, I'm living through you
Being happy is obtainable, but it's also unsustainable
But I'm still gon' chase
Y'all want that raw shit right?
Got me tossing in my bed with my thoughts at night
Down in these trenches I'm here running
Away from it all so my brain escapes it
Y'all see me like the superhero shit, I wish it was true
