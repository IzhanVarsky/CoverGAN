Even around us, gettin' high
I got them mushroom caps and acid with Peyote for days
Drugs in the trunk, you need 'em, I got 'em
You don't got yours? It's cool, I got mine
Gettin' high-igh-igh, yeah
Strung, holdin' in a dirty motel
I got that paraphernalia, riding off in the desert
And Dr. Gonzo in the whip, my bih'
Shit I got everything that you could even imagine
Clouds in my reach, seeing birds-eye, coastin'
Pockets always full of sunshine
With Psilocybin inside of my potions
Weed to the speed, believe I got options
I got medicine from Mescaline, Excedrin
Yeah, I got a Ayahuasca shaman, Hunter S. Thompson
Acid, high-dosing
I got the drugs
Mushroom eatin' in cabins, way out
Psychedelics on me, I don't even know where I'm headed
I got the drugs in the luggage at the Super , yeah
Ooh, I got them psychedelic drugs leadin' my way
Got them psychedelic drugs leadin' my way
I got the drugs in a suitcase
Deep in the mountains, no one's
When the drugs hit hit, recline and get launched
I got those micro-doses, macro-doses, I'm on a wave
I got that boost up in my aura and I'm feelin' myself
Shit
Yo, got my third eye wide open
Put your seat in the upright position, we gone
High by the beach, up in the sky, floatin'
To infinity and beyond
Woah, Webby Airlines takin' off
