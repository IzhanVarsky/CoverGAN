No forgiveness for my sins
Running
'Til somebody give me a shot, won't stop shooting
'Cause I miss percent of shots I don't take
I'm on the run, on the run
When all my methods applied and they met their demise
Moves that I make and the record's set soon that I'm breaking
Hang it up, while I took loss and doses
I'm not slowing down
No other option, they all watch it
Oh this hopeless prognosis make most just
My evolution is not human
Bow
Worked too hard for this, I'm not losing
I'm living on the run
The pot's bubbling, my stock's doubling
When I load up the chamber the whole place better
Hit with a boom, the room shaking
'Bout to burn this whole place to the ground
Make my living on the run
Rock it
So large it's a miracle I'm here to show it
I'm on the run
Stepping on the track to win the whole race
Dead or alive I'ma get to thе prize
Move it
No matter what lap I'm in, I won't wait
Disregard traffic signs, I'm not stopping
Only way to pass the time that I've gotten
And they all a lap behind while I'm jogging
With a . with more rounds than a
There wasn't a day since then I stopped hustling
Merry-go, there he go, stereo sound
How many points by now have I proven?
Started at the bottom at hunger and got nothing
Hit the floor before I kick the door down
Shoes hit the pavement and everything in view's for the taking
Baby you gon' feel the temperature rise so keep running
It makes no difference on the run
No brakes
Told 'em I would get to the finish, I'm not bluffing
Show 'em the truth, I'm through waiting
My competition bettеr go hide or get a disguise
At my lowest still I stayed focused
