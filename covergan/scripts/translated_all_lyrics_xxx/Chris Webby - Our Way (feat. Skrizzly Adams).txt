Just bottle that feeling up, and do not let that feeling go
We all gotta' find within us the thing that inspires you
We been rising with the heat so, we grow
All I know is what I've seen
Flipping on that beast mode
Third eye blind, open sesame
And always know that, as we travel down this long dark hallway
Ever since somebody drew the lines that divided us into nations
We all got one shot at life, and I'm willing to die to live it
Amigos, who recognise we all one people
So bring in the violinist, and bring in the choir too
We might be bruised but we’re not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
Lines drawn in the sand and everybody is divided
'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way
Change fundamentally, swap ego out for empathy
We 'gon make it our way
All I know is that we gonna' make it our way
I've seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
And nobody is perfect, regardless of who you love
And everywhere that we go, we walk around as equals
'Cause we 'gon make our way through it eventually, mentally
Make it our way, 'til the river runs dry
Designed to give rights to the trials and tribulations
I’ve seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray
Make it our way, ’til the river runs dry
Political party biases really were all the same beneath the surface
Presently, fulfilling destiny and becoming who I was meant to be
Or regardless of who you worship
Now think of that thing, and use it to drive you
And trying to keep my composure as everything is declining
Difference in pigmentation, religious affiliation
Make it our way
They say I'm a non-believer
Gotta' use it to pick you up, whenever you feeling low
All I know is what I’ve seen
And I say...
We might be bruised but we're not broken, no surrender, minds awoken
But living under pressure is bound to produce a diamond
We all got survivor in us, we all got that fire in us
I'm just trying to find the silver in the lining, just trying to keep on surviving
Hey, make it our way
Mind over matter is the metaphoric cheat code
The thing that'll wake you up, the thing that's inside you
