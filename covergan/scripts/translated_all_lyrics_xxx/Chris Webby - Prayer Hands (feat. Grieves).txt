I bet you thinking you could probably hold a spot
Somebody should've told they ass that I was on the brink
Then I got her on my stick
I'm out here buying property, you fighting over crumbs
Better widen up your stance if you plan to take a shot
I prefer when a motherfucker acting like he can go and get it
My microphone cold as a bitch
That they can come and get it if they really want the smoke
You ain't talking in my face, then I don't know what else to tell you
'Cause I'm spilling while I'm sippin', every shot is in the frame
I'm up and I'm down, ducking you clowns
They been sleeping on me like their dinner plans, tryptophan
Holding a hand full of grit
Hallelujah
Yeah I'm seeing all these sheep around, I'm feeling like a goat
They keep try'na catch you slipping, always pushing 'round a mop
You can take it up with management, they handle little fellas like ya
Sippin' wine I made from water
Shit I gotta go see my dentist
Every single day it's been a battle fighting off the Devil
Don't make me fuck around and plunge
Any time they wanna find me, I be ready for the drop sayin
I just wanna turn the beat up, make you put your hands together
Take the world over like Pinky and thе Brain, switching lanes
Better say some "Our Father's", holler
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I'm the father, son, and fucking holy ghost, hallelujah
I've been on a level, on a level
Yea my skill-set is tremendous
I been around the block, heard a lot of talk
Rolled up and thrown in a ditch
I'm on different levels every week
These motherfuckers talk so much, then wonder why I drink
And now I'm getting plaques
Some of that'll get you stitched
Yeah I tried to tell 'em though
The consensus in the game is I'm relentless
By the time I end my sentence
Keep the change, got my heart on my sleeve like a liquor stain
From a rapper to a boss and shit, they thought this shit's a gamе
While my diet's been nothing but Ritalin in my hand
Word to the web that's on my necklace
Then I'm dippin' with your wifey
Hit it, Quidditch, I'ma kill it
Don't even need a spotter
I'm already on the edge bitch
And a half a pound of mushy's in the van, this the plan
They full of shit, colostomy, get off of me, I'm done
When you know that he ain't gonna do shit
Learned that shit from Harry Potter
I don't give a damn, still the man
I'm on different levels and they know
They gon' know I spit that venom
I don't give a dam if you've been bumping at the gums
Pick the world up and I bench it
