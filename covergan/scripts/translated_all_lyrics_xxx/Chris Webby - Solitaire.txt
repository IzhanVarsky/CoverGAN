I'm bringing you that sound you missed, that lyrical flow
Right now, shit, I see it right in front of me
With bacon, egg, and cheese, shit I'm stayin' fed
Like it's motherfuckin' Solitaire
And the tats on your face and the likes on your post
Which is now the societal norm
They know that if they steppin' up they'll be in my Raw Thoughts
I can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
They scared of me like I'm tucking a sawed-off
Steezy, put this shit down for CT
Chris was born to rule so I'll ride out the storm of wackness
And grind your bones into dust just to make my bread
I'm crazy, la vida loca, fee-fi-fo-
Why everybody running full speed down the street
And just the thing, these the cats that used to laugh at us
It's like I'm playing
No respect for the OG's who started it all
Why is everyone afraid of me? I get it, I'm fuckin' crazy B
Which is fine, I'm an only child anyway
Motherfuckin' Solitaire
To spar with Godzilla, you don't have the guts
Why these wack little kids out thinkin' they the king?
I've been a little bitter, but kept on getting bigger
If rap was a video game, you'd play on G-Eazy
Listen, I'ma count to , before I break 'em down like I got an ounce to flip
It's autopilot when I go and grab the mic and record
They bow to their new king as I wore the crown
Tryna bring that fire back, my time is gonna be
And since Mac Miller unfollowed me on Twitter
A legend of the new school you're about to see
The shit that y'all been bumping is some fuckin' trash, I will not stand and watch as my love of rap dies
I got 'em all scared by the flames I spit, and claims I make
Just playing Command and Conquer, now I have conquered the future
You just ain't quick enough on the draw, ain't fast enough
And lyrically superior to most my peers
I'll crush your motherfuckin' skull like The Mountain, bitch
But you're neutered, no balls at all comin' through ya better run
Into the real thing, now I live my story
They see the look up in my eyes and they get afraid
Like Old Mcdonald, try to follow as I speak I know
Fum. You're done when I come through to take your head
All I'm saying's I don't give a fuck, I'll be comin' at all y'all
Pause
No more skill, no more soul, and no more bars
So now, nobody ever wanna play with Chris
So I'm all by myself here as I play
So keep on spreadin' rumors and keep on thinking you cooler
Fuckin' Solitaire
So I guess I gotta be the motherfuckin' bad guy
This is how it's always been, live it everyday
They can't ignore the sounds, I'm a warrior now
They thinkin' that I'm dangerous
And put it in a song, let the people bounce to this
To what we got now, Mumble Rap, top of the charts
You got no chance, like fist fightin' gorillas
And I'ma call 'em out (Why?)
(Listen, I don't need no help, I'ma do this shit by myself)
But I wish I had some friends in this game and shit
Ain't no passion for the craft, all hype, it's a joke
I tore shit down and torched them, now all around
I'm just sitting in my sandbox, all alone, patiently, yellin' out
And call me, a fucking loser 'cause I sat on my computer
I've been in these gladiator pits workin' on my swing
It's almost like if you know how to rap, then it's wack to these kids
And got a couple torpedoes for all these Little Yachts
But I'm also watching hip-hop decline and wondering
That Molotov flow, I'ma scorch the ground
Fuck it, I'm raw dog
'Cause fuck 'em, that's why (Oh)
When is real shit gonna be showin' up on my screen?
Please! When is hip-hop coming back on the scene?
They don't wanna play with me, they afraid of me, I know
All they care about is swagger and cash
All that shit that you don't hear anymore
But I'll have the last laugh, 'cause I'm bound to be
How these other lyricists could stand by so comfortably
Smokin' hella weed, watching Rick and Morty
So now no one wants to play with me
Me, I'm G, expert mode, please believe me
Focused on my dream 'til that shit was morphing
As the shit we grew up on dissolves, devolves
Call me Maximus, on every track I bust
And know Webby goin' sick a lot, ammunition box full of shots
An animal, follow my name with E-I-O
I'm so fuckin' good at my job, I don't try anymore
I am the mic, the microphone killa
The shit you couldn't buy in the store, indeed I flow
And killing everything until the fuckin' day I'm dead
While the game ignored me I've been sippin' 's
'Cause they scared to throw it down with me
