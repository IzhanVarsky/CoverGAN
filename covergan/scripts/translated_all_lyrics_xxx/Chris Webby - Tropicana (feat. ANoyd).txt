I got the bag like Santa
I got the clip with the banana, banana
Drop the kind of shit you press and play and keep it on loop
I got the juice like I'm squeezin' on fruits, I'm leadin' the troop
They ain't messing with the mango or the lemonade I got
The Tropicana, woah
This ain't artificial flavor in our concentrates
I'm stayin' steezy and loose at ease in the booth
Yeah
Covers everything the light'll touch
Pomegranate with banana
Yeah, I've been the greatest, highly imitated when I drop
I'm one dude you cannot replace
I got the juice, nananana
Get yourselves a cup, bottoms up
The king of every jungle ask Rafiki my savanna
Ani-mal, don't let me get my hands on ya
Make your cutie smile with the shit I say
Still I stay on top, shit, I never miss when takin' shots
I got the grapes, I got the squeeze you can't touch
Breaking through all the parame-ters
Here to Indiana to Atlanta
I give the people what they wanted, you feel me?
Reakin' havoc like Donkey and Diddy all through ya city
So much juice that my refrigerator stopped, they can't stop the pace
I got the juice
Nananananananana
From simple to complexity that you can't even compute
What can I say? I'm that dude, always been that way
Stamin-a, like Kung Fu Panda, bruh
Puttin' on a show, you better get your came-ras
To Louisiana, all the way to Cana-da
Remember
Truly wild, step up in that building King Louie style
Until I make an illegal turn and the officers get me
I'm speakin' the truth, as it's always been since I was juvenile
I got the Tropicana
The Tropicana, nananana
I'm off of the wall like a flat screen robbery, really
I got the juice, that Tropicana
