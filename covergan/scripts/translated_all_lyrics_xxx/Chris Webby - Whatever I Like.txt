I'm at home on the stage, I fuck your head up
And honestly I gotta be a paranoid
I got no rules I'm not prohibited or limited
Webby back up in this bitch, running at the fucking lip
Between the economy, astrology, and bath salt zombies, I'm like
Now we need Adderall to wake up, an Ambien to sleep
Tell me how they locking people up for bags of 'dro
The people making laws the biggest criminals on the globe
Kids today are learning what they know from Wikipedia
The shit is got me saying
I don’t give a fuck if you don’t like me
You’ll never find another motherfucker like me
And you won’t sit you’ll see sick like the boat rocking on waves
So I light up a doobie and exhale, blowing smoke up in the sky
Feminine feelings about my opinions just let me know that I'll be scarier
And kids are learning social skills from Facebook and Instagram
Bitch I do whatever I like
Free style equal free speech; I thought this was America
And everybody on the street is on their phones like they don't give a damn
A dog in the rap game and still ain't got no bone thrown in my cage
I'm in a whirl-wind, I wonder where the world went
With grimy politicians and twisted Mayan predictions
Proud to be American? Huh, yo fuck the government
I'm like fuck it, let me just enjoy my time while I'm living
Of a view that will show you how a falcon moves
I'm so fly my attitude will take you to a cruising altitude
Vicodin to ease the pain and steroids if you're feeling weak
America, home of the free, land of the brave
And search to find the truth through all the bullshit that they feeding us
And everybody knows, a fucking country is controlled by corporations, CEO's
Like trying to run a comb through the braids
Excuse me if I'm offending you, suck my dick my people is feelin' it
Cause that motherfucker can help you find me faster than my girl can
Feeling is different now that I'm old enough to see right through the media
While I'm looking at chemtrails
Soon as I pick up a mic (soon as I pick up a mic)
Technology fucked us up, and Siri you're a fucking slut
With these words that I write (with these words that I write)
The way this world turning is beyond me
Generation RX, now I'm fucking dependent
I do whatever I like (I do whatever I like)
A fucking immature juvenile, only thing wrong is my age
The president ain't doing shit
Cause I watch my iPhone but I feel like my iPhone is watching me
Somebody stepping to the kid is unlikely, so bite me
And take whatever pills the fucking doctor says you need in ya
And this world is fucking up, this world is fucking us
On attention medications cause I've been on em since I was seven
