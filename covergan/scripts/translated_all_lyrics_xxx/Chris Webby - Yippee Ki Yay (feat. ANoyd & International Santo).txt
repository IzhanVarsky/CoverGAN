Tequila juice in syringe injected into our livers
Be honest, I can hear you from a hundred feet away
I got a big roar, big suite on the sixth floor
Even with the paid time off, I'ma grind hard
It's Yippee Ki Yay (Yippee Yippee Ki Yay)
And became a black belt at the same time
I don't give a fuck about a critic, um
"Yippee Ki Yay", don't forget it, um
I'm glad you came by"
I should say, "Welcome to the home of zero fucks
Drinkin' to the last drop as lightweight
Ice cold flow, cryogen'
I'ma live Yippee Yippee Ki Yay either way
Comin' for your fuckin' neck like you're rockin' a chain in the water with Barracudas
Fuck an IOU, I leave an I owe N-O one
You can tell the difference, Eminem and Xzibit
I frost, ice ice, vanilla ice ya'll
That's how you makin' a name by
And you know we goin' right on in
I go insane, look at the brain, look at the play by
I go to Spain, take it in vein, I go to Shanghai
I been on a wave and I did it my way
EightyHD, EightyHD
Lights on, lights off, shootin' on a tripod
Stone cold like I'm looking at Medusa
I'm such an animal, I'm showing up when Noah's Arc ship boards
Ya'll p? We EightyHD, fully high def' emcees
Click-clack, bang when I aim the bazooka
Webby dope, ya'll just really gotta listen to tell
Mammals on land, god damn, yo, I got this
Yellin' out, "Yippee Ki Yay"
I'm rubbin' off on my pupils like pinkeye
Trippin' like aquatic
And I wave bye, and became high
Say what's on your chest and what you feel, man, dígame
Dark side, call me Kylo Ren
I'm on a plane, no, I'ma hang, no, I'ma hang-glide
I'ma die hard, drive off, better give me five stars
Killin' it well from livin' through Hell while fillin' the L
Better reconsider where you scuba
vision better watch it, ow
And when I drop shittin', you on the stool like a pigeon
Lyrical semi-automatic and I'm letting off shells like I'm jumping on a Koopa
Knowin' that one day I'd be livin' this well
And we gon' get it all day
Pull the rip chord, paratrooper
Need I say more, it should never had to be that way
Motherfucker, we goin' right on in
Tell 'em what it's gon' be, new school OG
If you get in my way then I'm diggin' your grave
You livin' Yippee Ki Yay or you live bait
Stack my deposits, hot shit, cookin' with the phonics
Puttin' weed smoke in the breeze
Big money, big score, big big tour
Give little fucks like midgets stickin’ up middle fingers
vision and I'm still living irate
I'm living proof that the kid is more Brucer than Willis
I'm self made in the Lion's den
Shit, I'm big ill, where the sick ward?
'Cause part of being human is making stupid decisions
The boy fresh like I still got silica gel up in the pocket
