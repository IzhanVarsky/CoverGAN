I know everything just by looking into your eyes
Whether it's a person's name or a very bad word
nobody knows
write it here
everything that hurt you
I'll give you a piece of paper and a ballpoint pen
I don't know, from the beginning yeah
you're slowly dying
Without anyone knowing, I'll throw it away
Promise me my friend
Maybe I just can't hide with my expression
Waiting for me to write boldly
It's not the time to care who you are
Ooh
I'll use it until my palms turn black (uh huh)
where to start
Black ballpoint pen (I'm serious)
Give me that paper (gimme that)
I'm sorry I didn't know earlier
I've been thinking about it, I'll give it a try
I just need you to be by my side (I can give it to you)
if you can't tell
I'll laugh as much as I can now
what's wrong with you? what's the matter
why do you avoid
thank you so much
It seems that my heart is caught by the sharp tone of voice (damn)
Can you write down what you want to say?
Promise me my friend (my friend)
Is nothing wrong? that's weird
