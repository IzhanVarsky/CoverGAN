Out through the atmospher–µ
We always were dysfunctional
I hoped that I might find you here
Good morning stars
Good morning moon
Just when we got comfortable (Ooh)
Heaven through my telescope (Ooh)
Good morning god
You had to leave
This city like a wrecking ball (Ooh)
'Cause I'm so high
Nothing's gonna bring me down today
To earth just like a souvenir (Ooh)
I'm feeling indestructible
Nothing's gonna bring me down (Ooh)
million light years away
And bring you back
Where did all my wishes go
I've been looking for
Nothing's gonna bring me down
Just rolling through
Good morning love
CHORUS
Up like a rocketeer
I'm gonna fly
