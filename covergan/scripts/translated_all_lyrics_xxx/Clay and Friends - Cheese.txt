Fixing all her broken dreams
I be Michael Angelo
Dandruff in my hair
You can call me on my payphone
Eat you like a cantelope
Every day is day off
Take you to Galapagos
Fly fly in my rocket yeah
Ooh la la la
I was Adam she was Eve
It's the way that we run
Everyday is swish on the lay up
Gurl you are my antidote
Baked up when I wake up
She had curves like Italian roads
Baby that was half a dose
Baby got the passport and her pair of Calvins
She wants to go back to Montreal
Lisbon one-way on a whim
Daughter of no one like Darlene
Form
Film in my Leica
Making bread and smoking cheese
Uno dos yeah we going up
Baby she's got her trip
Toke toke when I take off
She lost the thread like Ariane
You don't need the Air Miles so much, stay fly
I b–µ Michael Angelo
To the moon imma take you the darkside
