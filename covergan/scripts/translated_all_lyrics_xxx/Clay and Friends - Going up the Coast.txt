I packed it all like Anderson
Better than drowning in gin
In a minivan that broke
I was going up the coast
Ain't got no saint to blame instead
Pack my bag up, sick of home
Never showed up for the showbiz
I was driving in a van, I was older than
Brown sugah, she called me
When I knew why I was singing
No more homies on the block, like
She answered, I know
To end up where it all began
On the coast they never lose it
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
On the corner like a stoplight, yeah
Never homesick down that road
To get back to the beginning
Of my reflection, so I dreamt
This hard rive, gone save me
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Off the tip of Argentina
Used to want to live in Brooklyn
I, and I plus five, heading Kanye West
With a view from my apartment
The last time we spoke
