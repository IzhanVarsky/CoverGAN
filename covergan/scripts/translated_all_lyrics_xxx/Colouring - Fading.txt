I don't know how to let go
Just two kids we are
I'll be waiting, waiting now
With only ourselves to blame
Fading, fading out?
Where do I go from here now?
We'll light up thе world together again
Cried all of your makeup on my shirt
Is it just too much to fix
And we're shouting in your car
Baby, baby now
Am I ever gonna see your face again?
It was you always
Is all of your love
All the stupid things we said
Say it's not over yet
I'll never give up
Call it just a drill
And I'll find you down another road
Oh-ooh
Broke this world we built
Darling, don't leave this way
How do I find a place to call home?
I smell of booze and cigarettes
To keep alive the flame?
Just say that this is not thе end
Don't give up
I was built by your heart alone
