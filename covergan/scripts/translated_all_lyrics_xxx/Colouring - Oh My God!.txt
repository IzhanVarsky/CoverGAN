Oh love, see me holding on
We're running round in circles here
What game do you wanna play
What else can I do but pray now?
(Wooo)
Oh god, are you giving me grace?
If I could meet you half way home
Now I've nothing left to lose?
Gripping on so tight till I kill it
Oh my god, I'm worshiping now
Where's heaven we found?
When we can turn the bends?
It's holy hell now she don't believe in it
I'll stick but you want the moon
Does that make the drug? Does make you the cure?
Will you still spin my world around?
It's holy hell, now she believe in it
Gripping on, where's heaven we found?
She's the judge and jury, executioner
It's holy hell now she believe in it
I said I'd give you everything
Oh lord, can you hear me now?
But what else can I really do?
Will there come a time
What can I do?
Oh my god, this love, I can't kick it
You know I believe in you
I'm worshipping now
Gripping on to something in you
We can turn bends
Let the soul out
And every word that I'm trying to get out
Oh lord, can you hear me now
It's you that I'm trying to serve
If I let you go now
"No, it's not enough," you say
And I'll say it again again again
Your blood so watered down
And I'll say it again
But how you flow through my veins
Oh my god, I'm broken in two
And we never seem to learn
And be the judge and jury, executioner
