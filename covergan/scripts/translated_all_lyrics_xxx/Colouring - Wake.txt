I wanna change
Too busy fighting off the fears
I'm now waking up ready to learn
I'm now waking up
You told me to try it
I'm not going back to yesterday
And you want to sail on, yeah
Feel like I'm trying
There's no going back to yesterday
Waking up ready to learn
Ready to learn from my mistakes
Trapped in a circuit you could break
I gave up the lying
And it don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing
And I want to sail on, yeah
Like you can be amazed
Wanting to give into the wind
The sun is rising over there
I wanna wake
And I wanna wake
If it don't make you feel
When you've arisen
