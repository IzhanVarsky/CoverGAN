If it get ashy, we can start applying love
You my partner, da-na-na-na-na-na
Your jellyfish theory we could master that
My Gambino is black not Italian
Depends on what you use for a lens
A gift in my life that can't be boxed in
So fancy free, 'cause I wanna be
To understand part of me
We we-weather-weather the storm
Understand living in love with no division
Let's write a love story, we don't know where it end
That's the only time you really wanna fight me
Really that glow is from your inner soul
Yeah, uh
Written in the sky above, it's a higher love
So fancy free, as I wanna be
You help me with my lines, tell me when my raps are wack
Any time I get with you, it's a dope date
Let's watch ATL, drink wine, and order Postmates
Gratitude, to the Most High above
Relationship journey is spiritual, lyrical
Red carpet looks I tell you when they coals
Mind full of Gotti, Soulcycle for the body
Use no stylist, you know I joke childish
Yeah, understand forgiving, understand commitment
Can't copy sex, still you can bite me
Love comes through and we get it on
Understand she gon' be like, "Nigga, just listen"
In you I got a friend, your kin is my kin
That could be the start of our black clan like Spike Lee
You are part of, da-na-na-na-na-na
I'm beginning to understand and understand women
That done changed 'cause of global warming
You a good DJ as long as you ain't blow
Background music either Anita or Ghostface
I was told God used rain to cleanse
Been through the PM just to see the dawn
You don't complain when I watch SportsCenter Top
This is sparks of, no matter what they call it
Ah, ah, new shoes, ah, ah, new clothes
Ooh– yeah
L-l-l-l-l-let's go on
I prayed for a woman, so I say amen
Over and over again, no more holding it in
I probably couldn't have done this, years ago
I love you this lifetime and after that
Ooh– yeah, yeah, yeah
You juicin'? Don't lose too much weight
So close, the future don't seem as distant
You get spicy, any time I act like a Pisces
Let's get gray, then we can die in love
Tell the first responders, this is a fire love
Ooh–
We can work, we can laugh, we can cry in love
Girl, in me, a King has risen
This is God's love, our love
When I'm sick you got remedies to battle back
Your hero's Angela Davis, mine's is Ali
They say it never rains in Californ'
