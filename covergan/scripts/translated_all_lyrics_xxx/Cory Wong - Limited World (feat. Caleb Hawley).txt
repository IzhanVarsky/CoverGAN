(Scooby dooby doo)
(Yeah man, check it out. I was hanging out with Cory Wong the other day)
Gonna show my attitude
Uber man
That fame don't last
Shoulda' never ever listened
If you go too fast
Chin up, take a seat
Ain't it gonna be great
Run out of gas
And they ain't seen nothin'
They were playin' different rhythms
Oh it's not what you think
Time to make an escape
But you're gonna burn out
What they've been missing
Change the world so fast
Listen up, turn around to the beat
Put your name on blast
Whatchu give ain't what you get
Ooh now you're dropping' names
Have it my way
Take your time and learn
Time to show this little town
Tryin' to make it last
And they called it 'old school'
Picked up my guitar
Shock 'em all so fast
(Yeah, we're pretty tight now)
Straight up to the gate
I've got a plane to catch
Get up, take a seat
Found a little bar
Somewhere in that northern loop
When I lay it down
Ooh thought you were gonna
Than I was used to
But it felt a little different
When they read my name...
(Cory Wong!)
Took a trip to Minneapolis
I don't want to be late
Ooh said you never would
Yeah... they went a little harder
And they ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeah!
They were never gonna
They be livin' in a limited world
Ooh when you gonna learn
A little about what you came from
To the rhythm of the prison
And you're gonna burn out
