'Cause it don't matter if I miss the train
I'm taking off today
But my pillow never hit my head
Maybe just five minutes more
Your love is shining all over my world
And when I go to bed
You helpin me make up my mind
They don't pay me enough anyway
And if they did I'd forfeit every dime to hear you say
'Cause you're a sight for sleepy eyes
You make me happy in the morning
Your sugar's too sweet to ignore
Some loving on which to dwell
I'm about to make the sun shine brighter in your day baby
But I give in the minute you give me
You make me wanna get up on the morning
Before it's even begun
If it's between working or playing with you
I'll take on the world tomorrow 'cause
And it's a wonder I get anything done
All my troubles stay far away
Better run if you don't plan on making something of yourself
Before the sun even rises
With your kind of love in my life
'Cause it don't matter when you take me on
And I'm gonna have my day made
And they get put to use instead
You take all my naughty thoughts
With the first tease of the sun
And it feels like I've been dreaming
With kisses sweet you wake me
