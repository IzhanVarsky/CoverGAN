Fuck the money and the boxes of Nikes
Give me more love in my real life again
(Give me more love in my real life again)
Super life, into the trends, to the top
Give me the discounts, I want more for free

I just want a little love in my real life
Infinite content, I'm not talking nonsense
All in the network, but alone
I optimize my time, umpteen appointments and go live
Know most of my smiles via Hangouts and Skype
I want to see more than just pics tonight

Smash me through the digital jungle like an ax murderer
I swipe left in the arm
You know what? Black Mirror was sci fi
Don't do all this just for a handful of likes
Please don't make me wait too long
One account for everything and keep forgetting the passwords
Today that's all my life
