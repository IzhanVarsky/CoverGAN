One moment I have you the next you are gone
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
This boy's got my head tied in knots with all his games
I simply want him more because he looks the other way
Oh I cannot solve
It's true I crave you
Or so I've been told
Dripping in gold
My heart broke when I saw you kept your gaze controlled
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
A wave of heads did turn, or so I've been told
Around his little finger, that boy has got me curled
I try to reach out, but he's in his own world
Crave You
I am craving you
Yeah dripping in gold
They stare at me while I crave you
Surely I can't fall, into a game of chase
Let's just stop and think, before I lose face
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
They stare at me while I stare at you
I walked into the room dripping in gold
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
