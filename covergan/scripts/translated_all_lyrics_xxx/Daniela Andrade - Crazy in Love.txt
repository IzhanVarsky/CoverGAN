I touch on you more and more every time
When I talk to my friends so quietly "Who he think he is?" look at what you've done to me
Got me looking so crazy right now
Cause I know I don't understand
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
When you leave I'm beggin you not to go
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
Cause I still don't understand
Call your name two, three times in a row
Got me looking so crazy right now your touch's
Got me looking so crazy, my baby I'm not myself lately I'm foolish, I don't do this I've been playing myself
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
Lookin so crazy your love's got me looking
You got me going crazy
But baby I don't care
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy in love
Cause baby your love got the best of me
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Baby you're making a fool of me
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Baby you got me
It's a funny thing for me to try to explain
Got me hoping you save me right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now
Oh oh oh oh
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Just how your love can do what no on else can
