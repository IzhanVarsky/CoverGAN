We are bound together, now and forever
And I will never let you go
You can tell me anything and I'll listen
There isn't anywhere that I would rather be
And I could never let you go
Oh, you are yet to learn how to speak
Three birds of a feather
Believe me, I'll always be there, so
When we are together
I might even know what to say
As if the stars have started to align
What do you think about things?
But either way
Believe me, I will always be there, so
When we first met, I will never forget
Though I know I love you
'Cause I don't understand you
Baby, I can't wait to know
'Cause even though I didn't know you yet
I just hope you enjoy our company
I find it hard to see how you feel about me
We were bound together, then and forever
It's been some time and though hard to define
There!
At least I'll be
