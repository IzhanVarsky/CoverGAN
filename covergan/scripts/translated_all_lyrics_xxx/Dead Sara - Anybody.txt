From the silence when I asked how you've been, ah
'Cause all I know is do or die
Head up, head up, 'cause I want you so proud
And I heard it from the voices in the rain clouds
And I heard it from your cousin in the doorway
No you won't let me down
I'm lost, you're lost, but you know we're not lonely
Are you gonna let me down?
Anybody, anybody
Do I belong? Do I belong? Do I belong?
Want me
No you can't let me down
For the love
And I heard it from the rooftop
That you were coming in, ah
And I heard it from your best friend
Do I belong to anybody?
From the mountains that you were coming in, ah
Come on and touch me
So loud, so loud, I just wanna hear you scream it
Move your mouth, move your mouth, I just want it out loud
Call out, call out, I was hoping you'd find me
When I asked how you've been, ah
Walk it off, walk it off, and don't you slow down
