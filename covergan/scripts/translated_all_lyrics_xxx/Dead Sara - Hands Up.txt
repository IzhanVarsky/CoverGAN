I don't believe that look in your eye
As you leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
Well, I've had enough
Saying nothing said it
Landing just where my body lay
Throwing the heartache onto the flame
Yeah, so you can say that you've had enough
Shaking off the dirt to get a look at you
Oh yeah
Clear desperation
Well, I've had еnough
Full-blown panic, you were howling at the moon
They're just fragments of imagination
Yeah, you're waiting for me to mess it up
Pulling the tulips up by the roots
With your hands up
You said it doesn't matter, but it bothers you
It's hard to forget what you never knew
Leave mid-conversation, so frustrated
Yeah, well, I am
But I couldn't talk out loud
I'm blacking out
As you leave mid-conversation, so frustratеd
Hands up, hands up
Give me a reason to even try
And I don't believe that look in your eye
With your hands up, hands up, woo
With your hands up, hands up
The power to choose and the right to refuse
And I feel frustration
When you piece it all together
