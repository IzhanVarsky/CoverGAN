May we take notice in regard to the unknown
So I sit and dwell on all the things I know are wrong
I don't wait, I don't wait for it
Heaven's got a back door too
If I made it this far being who I am
For the things that I can't choose
From the things I know are true
I've never been your perfect song, your favorite daughter
But I'll wake up to leaves on the ceiling
When will I stop running
I've never been a perfect soul, oh
To be gone
I've never been on the same sidewalk as a steeple
I don't know whether to the press me farther or the people
Maybe heaven's got a back door too
Heaven's got a back door through
And I'm running through
I'm through feeling sorry
Telling me all the reasons why I'd die alone
A back door too
It's not your time to go and waste it
Out of walls I heard the voices of the preacher
Been wondering why you said
And it's all about your timing
