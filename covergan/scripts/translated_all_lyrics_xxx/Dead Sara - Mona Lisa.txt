It's all right, put me back
Hoo, hoo
Hmm
I know what you want
(Oh, I really hate, I really hate us)
Cleaning my hands are my bloody fingers
Mmm
Throw some salt over your shoulder, baby!
Hoo
I'm as addicted as the lips to your cigarette
'Cause I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
But I'm doing all right
While I was thinking of it
Well, I just thought I'd mention
Come on, baby, show me your favorite
I'm so cold and lonely, I could be dead
My brain is scattered like the thoughts in my patter (Ha!)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me, c'mon
I got a new low
Ha
Forward put me back
But it's not gonna be what you like
All in favor, take a stand and defend me
And it's not gonna be, not gonna be
All right
I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
I said
To adore you
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me
