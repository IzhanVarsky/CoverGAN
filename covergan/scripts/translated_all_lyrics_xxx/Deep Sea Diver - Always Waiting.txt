As I crawl and I drag my heels in the wilderness
With white noise and thoughts that abuse
Now you're the one I can't get through
I was a shield, I was so cruel
And I wait
Always waiting for the right words to explain it
Ooh, I was a shield, I was so cruel
But the time won't ever come if you're
Cause I'm always waiting for the right words to explain it
And I'm always waiting for the right words to explain it
But the time won't ever come if you wait
I keep filling up the room
I am a shield deflecting you
I hear your voice, you know I'm running on fumes
