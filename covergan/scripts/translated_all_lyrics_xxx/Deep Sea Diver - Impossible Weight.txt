It’s an impossible weight
So I’ll just let you down now
On my way it’s ok
Picking up the pieces
Never mind
Spit it out
Dragging my heels around
Put ‘em down
I think I’m addicted to the fear
Wondering how I got here
Stray talk clicking in my ear
Stop dragging my heels around
Steady as the wheel turns
A million times tongue tied
Cliff dive broken mind
From the hurry up
Stutter in my heart
But that was then and this is now
I tried so hard not to let you all down
This is what it feels like walking in a straight line
This is what it feels like
