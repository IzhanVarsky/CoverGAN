I will follow the sound of the owl
Bless this house, bless my pillow
Bless your pillow
Our arch undone, our arch undone
Sandpaper and gum, leaning and propped
To get rid of me, every single piece
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
Desire, my long way
Lovingly
Desire
The wrong way
Desire, where you want to be?
