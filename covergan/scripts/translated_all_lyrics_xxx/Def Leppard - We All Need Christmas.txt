We all need Christmas, we all need someone to need
So here's to you, and all you do
Open your heart and let love breathe
Ohh let it last
Follow your heart, and let love lead, this Christmas
Open your heart and let love breathe, this Christmas
They may be gone but, they still remain, in our hearts in our name
Let's raise a glass to all that's past, and to the future long may it last
So say a prayer to light the day, for those we've lost along the way
We all need Christmas, we all need love to succeed
Forever after let it be true, for me and you
And may the light shine on you, and trust your hopes to see it through
