And it's too late to cause a change in the tides
Right through where we shall remain for all time
Yeah, the time won't change this
As we slip on through, we promised to meet again somewhere
Through the haunted maze in our minds
So we slip into our hopeless sea of regret as I stare
This promise we made
This is our time, we devour the days ahead
Right through where I'll remain for all time
We've been possessed by these changing times
And time won't change this
We shall remain
Yeah, time won't change this
Through the haunted maze in your eyes
We're surrounded by debris of the past
It's how it'll stay
