I look around but it's you I can't replace
I'm watching you,,
I'll be watching you
I keep crying baby, baby, baby, baby pleeaase
Baby please
Every game you play
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
Every move you make
With every breathe you take,,
Oh oh oh oh I'm watching you
You belong to me
Every smile you fake
Every bond you break
Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
Every step you take
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
I keep crying baby, baby please
Every night you stay
Every single day
Every claim you stake
O can't you see
Every word you say
I dream at night I can only see your face
Every vow you break
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Every breath you take
