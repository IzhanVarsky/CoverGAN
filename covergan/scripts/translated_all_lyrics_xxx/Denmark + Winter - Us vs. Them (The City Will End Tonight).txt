Running
Bring me
Give me hope
Ohh-oh-oh
Run out of time
Bring me to life
The city will end
Take me now
Every slope
And it grows cold
Don't speak
It's not the time
We'll make it out alive
It grows cold
It's us against the world
Sinking under
I'm a memory
It's almost gone
I am whole again
Somehow we'll survive
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down, won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down)
Gone
The city will end tonight
