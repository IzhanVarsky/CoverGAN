Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
Cause there's a better life
'Cause there's a better life
Watch my daddy in bed and tired
I've been working so hard
If its the last thing we do
Iv'e been working so hard
You'll be dead before your time is due
He's been working so hard
For me and you
If it's the last thing we do
You'll be dead before your time is due......
People tell me, "there ain't no use in trying"
If it's the last thing we ever do
Wanna get away, get away
We gotta get out of this place
He's been working and slaving his life away
Where the sun refuse to shine
Wanna get away
In this dirty old part of the city
And one thing I know is true
Watch his hair been turning gray
