In the eye of the storm, I forget what it means to feel down
I'm warm in sweet surrender
With your love, I will settle
I will settle
Your love
Out of the madness, we're alone now
You are all I know
Oh
Here in the silence, no sound
You arms are shelter
Caught in a motion, 'round and 'round
Yeah
And your arms are shelter
