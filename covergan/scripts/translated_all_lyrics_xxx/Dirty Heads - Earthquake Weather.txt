I'd love to go to an island. That would be marvelous
World peace, climb trees, I'm deep
And the people of the land rejoiced as they drifted off into the sea
What a wonderous choir
I'm a getting going now, never feelin' better
We can go anywhere in the world, darling. You just say the word
And the earth spoke
Call it Sword Beach, yeah, vacation forever
Yeah, we all in this together
Can't kick sand if you're standing knee deep
And the sky sang
Technique, I'm deep, no sleep
Kick sand if there ain't no beach
We'll be singing, bye bye baby blue
Well, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
Can't talk high, too stoned, Rosetta
West Coast sinking, I'll go down with you
What's that even mean man? Ahh fuck it, whatever
It was a great separation
Never felt better, never been meta
Little bit of pain and a little bit of pleasure
Can't get drunk if there ain't no drink
Kick sand if there ain't no beach, no
Earthquake weather man, down for the elements
You ain't got shit then you can't get robbed
But you can't get high if there ain't no weed
And you can't kick sand if there ain't no beach
Toss all the money in the paper shredder
Left a couple chicks with a scarlet letter
Inside chilling out, smoking in my bathrobe
Can't go to work if you ain't got a job
Well this is earthquake weather
Southside overcast, breezy with the warm glow
Try to get me got, get a little bit of never
I hear New California's nice this time of year
Yeah, this is earthquake weather
Earthquake weather, down for whatever
