Close my eyes sometimes it feels as if I go away
A-a-ayy, I'm on vacation
I said, "it wasn't easy, but right now I'm living breezy."
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave
Daily, daily
Open arms, embracing life
Van Gogh my earlobe
Everybody go and live your daydreams up
My brother called me up said he saw me on TV
But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
Hard work, it pays off
Illuminate my future bright
As I work hard for all I need
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
So thankful for everything
I love the life I live and enjoy the ride along the way
I can't hear, I'm here though
Do this shit, I love it on the daily
My lack of the lazy has let me do shit that I love on the daily
Rejuvenate my inner light
I've got one life to live, and I wouldn't live it no other way
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
My life may be crazy
Every single day, every, every single day-ay
I'm happy now, it's paying me
Build this engine from the ground up, now my hands they ain't so greasy, feel me?
"I make a living out of living," yeah, that's what I say
Get to do this shit I love upon the daily
And all of which you gave me
Everybody sour like a lemon tree
Every single day, every, every single day
If you don't like your life, then you should go and change it
I may be a weirdo, but this is my year, yo
