Well it's in the blood
But I'm not giving in
It's in the veins somehow
I'm on to something good
If it feels like something comes from nothing now
Well it's in the blood, yeah
Seems too hard to find
Underneath my bed
You oughta know by now
Far beyond the lines
But it's in the blood, oh yeah
Not a ricochet
Taking me somewhere
But it's in the blood
Love is a monster
Oh, it's in the blood, yeah!
Oh, seems so hard to find
(Oh no, what a ricochet)
I might surrender now
No, not a ricochet
And I can't even swim
I walk on water now
It's in the blood
Still hear you laughing loud
Laugh inside my head
Oh, laugh inside my head
