And when I see you again
The rhythm machine through the smoke and the screen
Waveforms
Touch it, make it, shake it, yeah
Their eyes in the hills below
The rattle of drums, the click of my thumb
I see it there in your eyes
The reverb I feel, it signals to me
A long time ago, my heart was in two
Lost in the clouds above
Couldn't recreate it, yeah
Try to rearrange it, yeah
Waveforms reach through my mind
Radar scanning my mind
Take it apart and break it, yeah
All these rivers run dry?
It's never been far from sight
Oh, you wanna know why
And take me back there tonight
It's written in black and white
Their heads in the hills tonight
