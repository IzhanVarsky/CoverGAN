(Feel like, ‘cause it feels like love)
(Feels like, feels like love)
But we wade anyway, ‘cause it feels like love
‘Cause it feels like love, but it feels like-
But we accelerate, ‘cause it feels like love
I confess, I’m drawn to the wreckage
(Feels like love)
I will be waiting for you in the crossfire, crossfire
I will be waiting in the crossfire
Got my dress on my flesh is my weapons
Fool me once, I’ll be back for the second
‘Cause it feels like love, is it worth it
Am I wrong to be feeding this hunger?
Give me technicolor
We see the water and it’s riptide, tidal wave
You and I bring it out in each other
I will hold my ground ‘cause you’re the only one
And when my senses tell me I should run
(Feels like, ‘cause it feels like love)
Give me Armageddon
Follow the signs saying no way hit the breaks
Seeing red, black and blue, and I wonder
I know it looks like war, but it feels like love
