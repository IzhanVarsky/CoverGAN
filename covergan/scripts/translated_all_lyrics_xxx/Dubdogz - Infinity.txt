Don't know when it started
And I don't know when it ends
Oh, you know we are the infinity
That I'm gonna get the bends
Oh, you know we are the infinity (If you wanna)
Oh, you, oh, you, oh, you, oh, you
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity
And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel so much pressure
If you wanna
