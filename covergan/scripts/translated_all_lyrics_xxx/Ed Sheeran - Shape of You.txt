Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
I'm in love with the shape of you
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
Come on now, follow my lead
And now my bed sheets smell like you
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Although my heart is falling too
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
And last night you were in my room
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
So the bar is where I go
I'm in love with your body
And how your family is doing okay
Come, come on now, follow my lead
Come on, be my baby, come on
One week in we let the story begin
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
We're going out on our first date
We push and pull like a magnet do
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Every day discovering something brand new
I may be crazy, don't mind me
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Last night you were in my room
Girl, you know I want your love
