It’s true this doesn’t feel right
Never thought I would be this cautious
Wе’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
Are we too comfortable to ask for more
I’m being lazy can’t be bothered to fight
When did you stop running through my mind
We’ve been trying but we can’t move forwards
Think now its mind power wasted
I keep trusting nostalgia
Saying nothing but you see it in my eyes
If so, I’ll put the work in
Tired of tryna get it
I guess I’m worried that it’s me who’s caused this
Can’t lean on our sweet nostalgia
Been keeping quiet but it feels like torture
Never thought I’d feel indifferent
Convеrsations always turn into fights
Keep hoping thats what we still are
How did I miss the change from easy all the time
To something harder where I take all the blame
If we say it out loud is it over?
But I’m too scared to pick our last fight
If you pulled the curtains the end
It’s true the first year was too good
Sometimes I wish you would just make me hurt
False sense of hope for the future
Back then I thought we could make it
Conversations always turn into fights
I’m so tired of tryna get it right X
I’m tired of tryna get it right
I think we might need more
But it seems wrong to feel like I’m working
So I’d be forced to suck it up and adjust
But I think we changed back there, not sure how far
So I continue hoping you can read my mind
Can’t focus on what we were before
Kinda worried that theres no route for us
I hadn’t noticed till you said you did the same
