He can place my order 'cause he knows just what I wanted
He takes me out somewhere nice
My baby is always on time
My baby never, ever complains
It feels like he's reading my mind
Just us, a table for two
I don't want anybody else it's true
And there's not one thing that I would change
Any time of day I can call him just to say
And he wears that shirt that he knows I like
And he learns from his mistakes
I don't see him all the time
Just us at a table for two
'cause he knows how to get it right
But it doesn't matter 'cause he's always on my mind
He tells me how he feels and doesn't lie
That I wanna have him by my side
He loves me in subtle ways
Everything is in black and white
I don't want anybody else but you
You know I can't get enough of your love
