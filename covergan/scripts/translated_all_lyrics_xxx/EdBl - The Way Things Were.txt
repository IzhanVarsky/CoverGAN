Spent too much time trying to seem mature
When you were hanging out with such a fool
(I was the bad guy in a movie
But I still regret
I don't know why you stayed
The way things were
It must have been hard
Might be better now (oh, oh, ah)
But baby, don't forget
It's all a little better now
I took it for granted
Do you remember how they used to be?
To keep your cool
I was impatient
I was unsure
But I've come around and want you to be mine
Bad guy in a movie, movie)
On reflection babe, I won't do the same
Bad guy in a movie
(Bad guy in a movie
You must have felt so played
I was the bad guy in a movie
Might be better now
I know I took my time
I was the bad guy in a movie (bad guy in a movie)
Like we were back in school
I was the bad guy in a movie)
