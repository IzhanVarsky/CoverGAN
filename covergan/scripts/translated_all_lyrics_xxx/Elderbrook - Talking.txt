Or talk about it in our sleep
But I don't listen anymore
Whenever I'm in town
Or maybe I'll pick up a pen
But I should tell you, I love the sound
Oh, maybe we'll go out for breakfast
Well maybe I should bring her flowers
And then I'll send it when I can
And then I'll write her up a letter
They don't like me like before
It's like I'm always doing something
Oh, won't you tell me how you think?
Oh, won't you tell me how your day is?
Of myself when I'm
Anything that you want now
Could be the whiskey or the drinking
Of myself when I'm talking
Talking, talking, talking, talk
I try to visit when I can
I got a friend but they don't like me
I got a friend way back in London
When I'll do better, to talk about
Of myself when I'm talking, of myself when I'm
