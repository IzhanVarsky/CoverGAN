Won't you stay with me
And I stay for another day
I wouldn't trade for your embrace
Skies of gray
I learn to run off
I turn the light on
No matter what they say
So I can keep the pace
Wishing that I could free space
And see your pretty face
And never a moment goes by
I'm coming right back to you
I know you're never far away from me
No matter what day
If there's a way
I turn away
So I stay for another day
I turn the light off
And know you're never far away from me
