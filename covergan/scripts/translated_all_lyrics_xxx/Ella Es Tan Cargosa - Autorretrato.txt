The grass in the garden and your closet
What do you highlight with a marker?
The easy to understand, is you
The sentence, the paragraph, the poem, the verse
Your wallet, your scars
Your verbiage and your silence
And the chords that you will never touch
The things you put in your bag
The weekend binge
Your God, your cabals, your faith
the tone of your voice
Your library, your look, your iPod
But also the amount you smoke
and your bad faith
Your dreams and your profession
The way you carry the cigarette
the imprint of your thumb
You do not escape the self-portrait
And your breathing and of course
Your alter egos, your hiding places
They talk about you, they are your self-portrait
What do you do alone when walking?
your diary
Your harmonies, your melodies
Your diary, your diary, your diary
And Wednesday too
And the bags you don't use
They talk about you
