And who's gonna find me when I'm lost?
Yeah, I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
And I've spoken to my friends
And you should probably look for something new
The feeling's eating me alive
Calling you up, but you're keep falling back
Trying to rewind ’cause nothing stays the same
But they just don’t know who I am
So who am I without you?
Caught up in these feelings, I know I'm to blame
And I know that I'm flakey and I'm all kinds of crazy
All these moments, all my movements
I thought they were mine but now
'Cause I'd rather break in two than in a million parts
Only to stop before it pulls me all apart
I tried to fix it but I don’t know where to start
But I’m just who I am, alone again without you
I’m where I am alone again without you
And all these people telling me that I should let it go
But they just don't know who I am
Gave it all and now I don't know what is left
I tried to fix it but I don't know where to start
Here I am alone again, I did my best
And who's gonna find me when I’m lost?
I fall back into the same old pattern in my heart
But I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do?
And as time keeps slipping by
