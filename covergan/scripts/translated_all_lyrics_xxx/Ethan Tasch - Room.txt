February’s gone I threw it away
Lost my mind in my stuff
I’m out of room in my head
So tired of doing nothing
I’m going off the rails
Way too high to clean up
Left my clothes all over the floor
Everywhere I go I’m up to my knees
I can barely walk to my bathroom door
Hard to find anywhere to be
My mind just broke the scale
I’m in my room about to lose it
I’m way to tall for my bed
Been inside over twenty days
Way too tired to do anything about it
Half my life I’m sleepin’
I’m out of room in my room
