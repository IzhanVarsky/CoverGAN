Why are you so big headed
She likes me in my Nikes
Feeling so angelic
Hi-C got her loose
And I’m the realest (I'm the realest)
And I feel
Head to toe in my nice things
Hold the door for her nicely
Let me tell you we got the juice
I just can’t be modest (no)
How else would you expect my big, fat, juicy brain to fit into my skull?
If I should ever die
WIYULD WIYULD WHY
Asking who I’m seeing
Yeah, that’s alright
Champagne in the deep end (deep end)
I’m a goddess draped in velvet
Swear I must be fluent in the lines that I am speaking
You’re so overconfident and I’m intimated
Well I’m hot
Got a man or can I be him?
And that’s alright I think
I party every weekend (weekend)
We in the produce
And the heat makes the ice melt
Turn me to an ice cream
It’s not my fault I’m super duper fly I just can’t help
Break the ice for my dime piece
I have to have a bit of a nugget as you can understand
Lil Mop and I stay clean
I’m a Greek so she calls me Zeus
AND I FEEL
Aisle
Hair full of sequins (sequins)
Spiral stairway to Heaven yuh
Run it up like I’m running miles
I want a pyramid in Egypt
I’m waking up on beaches (beaches)
WIYULD WIYULD WHY WHY (yuh yuh yuh)
Ew, Evann
I think
She likes green
Line it up in that single file
WIYULD WIYULD WHY WHY
Even on a Sunday we still party while he’s preaching (ayyy)
But I stay stone cold
AM to the PM
That’s alright
Well
Like a deep freeze
Hispanics, Europeans
Talking to Norwegians
And I got people in my DMs
It’s alright to be jealous yuh
