But I'll piece us back together slowly, oh
Ohh, what I risk to be close to you
And not knowing what you're up to tortured me
Until all the lights were off
Ooh, these minefields that I walk through
Ooh, what I risk to be close to you
I didn't notice what I lost
That I'm calling you this late
Ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
We're broken in so many ways
Now this might be a mistake that I'm calling you this late
How the things you love don't last
Started bringing up the past
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough
Even though this isn't fair for both of us
Close to you
I still belong with you
Now this might be a mistake
Anywhere you, anywhere you are
Ooh, maybe I'm just a fool
