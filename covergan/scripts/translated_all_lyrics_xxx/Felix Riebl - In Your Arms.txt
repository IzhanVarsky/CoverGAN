(I'm afraid of all that still)
Except you, my only darling
That you tied me to the master poll I left behind, it's certain
The night is open as the sky looks through my window
As if the truth belonged to nothing
Hold me in your arms
'Cause this bed we've made's an ocean and I lie in it to be safe
Besides you know I never will
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, besides you know I never will
Brush acrossed my brow and then somehow I'll find a way to take ya".
It won't be long, the night is long.
You're the closest, you're the closest, you're the closest, you're the furthest.
Me in your arms, don't let me go
You call me lyin' and say "lie beside me always"
What's a feeeling, but emotion that is stealing something greaterAnd I won't decide to leave ya 'till I hear the morning breakage.
It won't be long, the night is long
The night is long and I will lay beside you
So just hold
While the sirens in the distance sing "remember being single?"
She said "I am a wonderer, I wonder 'bout you always
And if fits and storms don't bring us home
Then I won't be a sailor
The night is long and I'm afraid of that still
