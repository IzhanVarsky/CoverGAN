Have more fun without me
Sunny lights catch on the window
Where did all these people go
Sunny
As she gets up and leaves
Look at all those pretty shades of blue
Mamma
White LCD
It doesn't notice me
Rusty
Makes you weep
The smiles on the screen
Drown out
Hey there's a beach
Waiting for someone to answer
Just get out and leave
Makes me bleed
Is send a pic and give it all to you
Collecting dust
Waiting
The breeze is slowly slowly coming through
To blame myself for what
Scrolling up
Rusty old bike on the sidewalk
Am I the only one at home
Do they all hate my company
Mamma just wants us to get out
Taking our priorities
That's why I'm sitting here, letting the sounds of the TV
Missing the fun
But all I really really wanna do
