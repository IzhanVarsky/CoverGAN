It’s a lady for you, boy, now I can’t take no more
Baby it’s you
Now I should hang up, after what you put me through
Bad bad habit baby
It’s you explaining why you don’t wanna be alone
It’s A.M who’s knocking at my door?
It’s A.M who’s that ringing my phone?
And while there’s no one else makes me feel the way you do
Didn’t you tell me that you were all along
There’s no reason for me to talk to you
It’s a shame boy, but my heart is hooked on you
Ah well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
I’ve got a bad bad habit baby
She says that you’re her man, that she came to take you home
Except that no one else makes me feel the way you do
Well, you’ve been doing me wrong ever since I let you in, yeah
And baby it’s you
But it’s your love that thrills me to no end
