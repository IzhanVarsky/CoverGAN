Losin' myself and my will to fight
Run out of faith and I can't see the light
When your'e all out of reason and needin' a rhyme
Turned to pills to get high when the wine lost its taste
When all of the colors faded to gray
Stuck in a phase of bad habits I can't quit
Behind bars of regret relivin' my crimes
To drift through the sadness and the meaningless haze
Lost in a maze that ain't got an exit
To the song your heart's singin' and you can't find the line
Keep fightin' the battle, the war with your mind
I can't put my thumb on the hour or day
I feel like a prisoner doin' my time
I've come to know all good things come with my time
Down in the trenches at war with my mind
