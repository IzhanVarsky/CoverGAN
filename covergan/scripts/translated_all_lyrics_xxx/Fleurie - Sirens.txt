Hey are you listening? I cannot reach you
Held back the flood, until the sky fell
After the fire drove out the sparrows
I see the future covered in roses
Waves of gold as the door closes
Out in the darkness I saw an angel
I'm on the other side, trying to break through
I can hear the sirens
All of the clouds hang like gallows
I can hear the sirens (x)
