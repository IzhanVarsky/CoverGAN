My touch say it's the Midas
While you're hatin', I get money
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Got the key to my city, it's over
And I know what you came here to do
That auto-biography rover
If you're a freak, then you comin' home with me
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
Spendin' this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M-O-N-E-Y
Yo' girl just kissed a girl, I do bi chicks
(And they already know me)
Ladies, put your lipstick up
Then I double up tonkers
Put your hands up, oh
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Make you cough-cough, that's Bronchitis
Get that ass on the floor
My team blowin' on that slam
Double entendre, double entendre
Lift it, drop it, shake it
Bugatti for real, I'm cold, bruh
I set records, ratchets hol' up (I set records, ratchets hol' up)
Yeah, my girl, you've never seen her
I know what you came here to see
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
'Cause my tints by limousines
It's goin' down for real
We the plus, your man a minus
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Now bust it open, let me see you get loose
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky
