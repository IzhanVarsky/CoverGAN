To wish us luck
The child I’ll never have
The stranger on the sidewalk
Chasing the sun
Now are waking up
Try to make you laugh
It speaks for itself
See where once it was
All who’ve ever lived
The young, the old, the dead
The hand of fate rests on my shoulder
And you and I presently traveling west
It will be again
And I have lived a charmed life
Still I get the joke
