It’s okay to be alone
Let me be alone
But I don’t know what I want to do
It takes up time to pretend
You don’t have fear no more
(I just want to be alone)
You don’t have to fear at all
You don’t have to fear no more
Where do we go at the end?
I still don’t know what I want to do
(Just want to be alone)
You don’t have to-
Take a breath and beat ‘em all
