Now you're gone I float along
Rain your armies down upon me
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Poison to prepare
March across my back
On your orders, bricks and mortar
Now or never, no surrender
Calling on you, belladonna
Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Like embers in the air
Kingdoms to defend
Until your flag goes black
Under attack again
Now your king is dead
Saints and sinners make good prisoners
How could you understand?
