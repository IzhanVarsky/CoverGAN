And you have got me high
You never know what you will find
Spandex, leather hat, no tattoos
Call it drugs, call it caffeine
All your words have got my mind in a knot
Just like seeds you know they’ll grow
I need your love
I’m sick and tired of breathing in
I need your love (x)
You’re loving and leaving
But I’ve been falling down, down so hard
With all your loving and leaving
I look sad, but I’m happy
Hidden lies between the lines
Need your love (x)
Call it lust, call it sexy
I still can’t stop thinking
I got secrets I can’t control
Eat your love, girl I had to
I am mad all about you
All the other times
But I’ll take a drag
Still can’t stop thinking
