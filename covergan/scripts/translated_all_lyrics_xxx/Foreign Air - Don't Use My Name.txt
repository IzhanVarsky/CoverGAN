There’s no redemption
You should be careful now because I got my eye on you
You need to be careful now because I got my eyes on you
And there’s no redemption
Ropes are tied
You’re losing your head
No tears when you feel the knife
I got my eye on you
Cruising through red lights
Don’t use my name, use my name
Don’t believe you’re that important
Listen to me now
Oh, ropes are tied
No tears will be shed tonight
I was in your corner
This is my final warning
Don’t tell me that the truth lies
I gave you everything that you wanted
You’ve only seen my good side
Tied so tight
Get it out ya mouth
You went and turned on me
Gave you the good life
I gave you everything you wanted
Don't use my name, use my name
I feel inspired
I got my eyes on you
No tears when you see the light
