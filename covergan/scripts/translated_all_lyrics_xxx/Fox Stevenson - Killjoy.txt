To protect with my life
Leaving your eyes
I'll do what I can
Like watching the light
Man, I'm so addicted to the killjoy
To keep it alive
Can't take it it’s mine
Trying not to smile
To keep you alive
Oil and dust, blood and rust
Salt the earth, prove your worth
Hammer down, no more sound
Can't take it it's mine
I'll do what I have to
Try to survive
I watched the life leave his eyes
No, I’m not the man who does these dark things
Either I'm the host, or in control
And all in all I
Killjoy
I got a reputation as a killjoy
I do what I can
Taking you home
Twisting the knife
It was mine to find
Something inside me I think is drowning
High off the fumes of this killjoy
Something in my blood that's unfamiliar
Can't stop feeling that killjoy
