I never ever-ever tried to keep myself together
If we took it all back and gave it more time?
I'm just making my tracks and doing my time
Do you ever-ever wonder if we could've done it better
I never ever-ever try to keep myself together
'Cause I don't know how
Do you ever-ever wonder if we could've done it better?
