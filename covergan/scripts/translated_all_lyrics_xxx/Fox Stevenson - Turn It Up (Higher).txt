And we can conquer them instead
You have got to realize
What we become
And you think you've been here before
We'll be much better than the rest
Well then there's only one thing to do
What should I do?
Where nothing seems right no more
We need invigorating
And we can blaze a trail ahead
Will be determined by the things we will have done
My brain, my soul, my dreams, my life
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!
We've gone too far
So let's progress
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Hey!)
And you're in need of something new
But I'll blame it all on you
I've lost my arms and legs and eyes and ears to you
And I think I know just what to do
And if's too much to handle
We move too slow
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up higher!)
If you feel like it's over
And now we don't know where we are
I've been trying, oh, so hard
