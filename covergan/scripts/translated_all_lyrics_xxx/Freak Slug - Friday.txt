High, high
High
I love and hate her at the same time
Friday night, she stays at home
I don't think I'll be seeing her again
She's so lazy and I don't get why
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But I don't wanna make it long
I gotta close all the roads to her
Friday night, I watch her clean her room
I'm sorry how I did
So I could really be moving on
She wanna tell me how she's getting on fine
(Whatever she holds against me)
But still lovе her with all of my heart
She's looking to get me high
I wanna get her out the mess she's in
Maybe onе day she'll listen what I've been saying
But she don't ever wanna come to mine
But I don't think me and you work anymore
