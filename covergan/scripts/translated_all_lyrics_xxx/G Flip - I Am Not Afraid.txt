I am not afraid to do this alone
And I tried, and I cried
I've been sailing seas â€˜fore you jumped afloat
I am not afraid to do this alone (And I've tried)
(But she's been dead the whole time)
Calling Georgia to come alive
But she's been dead the whole time
Yeah, this here, baby, this here, babe, ain't love
A world that we had built
You know you're full of shit
And I've cried
Don't care if you don't like me
I know that it scares you, but I am my own home
A set of wings and free fall
Love, love
I picked myself up off the fucking floor
But I have overcome it
And acknowledge that you were not safe to love, so
It was hard to admit
Changing love, changing love changed me
Yeah, I have lost all that I had found
And now you're standing on the sidewalk
Picked myself up off the fucking ground
So take me as I am, watch me as I go
I am fine feeling lonely
I'll run with the wind and I'll grow
You know I don't mind that you're out the door
You were part of my story
I found comfort in what's here
And I've cried (Changing)
And I've tried (Changing)
Into my world where I own all
I'm standing on two feet now
I am not afraid to do this alone (And I've cried)
