'Cause you got everything I like
You keep knocking me out
Night out, I feel the pressure pressing me
That I can finally call you mine
Chest out, I'm trying to go through everything
If you keep laughing out loud
I'm as afraid as I've ever been
You're such a race car
And just keep pushing it down
I'll keep doubling down
Highlights, I'm staring but I'm listening
In this little car that you'll be sitting in
Deep breath, she already said yes to you
Just keep doubling down
Hoping by the end of tonight
'Cause you're a race car
Skin tight, those jeans are really killin' me
It's a two-way street
Eyes on the road, distracted
In this little car we've been sitting in
Ooh-ooh
Hot mess, just look at what she does to you
In this car that we've been riding in
Call you all mine (My little race car)
Racing away with my heart
This is as good as I've ever been
This is as good as I've been
I'll just be here on the ground
We talked through the rhythm and the blues tonight
It's a two-way street where it's happenin'
That smile could light the whole city twice
