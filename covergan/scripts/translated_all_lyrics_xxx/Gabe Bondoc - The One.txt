So I can see just who I am inside
You're the one, you're the one for me
And give the other half to somebody
I only wanna take half
Your hand and mine
So I got a round trip ticket
Forever this way because
Just as the day begins
But I don't wanna take it
And sway below our waists
And so it just keeps wishing
You're the one for me
Lovely as a ray of sun, the very first one
It's in the way you look at me
Who won't waste it, now
The way my heart doesn't listen
You're my hero and my best friend
Faithful and true
Fit perfectly fine
Will synchronize with yours
At the perfect height
And girl I swear you're a godsend
To Him and to you
You're the one, you're the one
Wishing you were close to me so that its beat
I will stay
The way you laugh with your mouth closed
You're the one for me, now
The way you smile so your eyes glow
