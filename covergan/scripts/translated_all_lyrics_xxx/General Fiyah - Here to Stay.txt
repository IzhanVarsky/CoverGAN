General Fiyah on the rhythm, THD got you moving
I'm here to stay baby
Come and do the rubber duck
It's my one heart desire
I'm blessed with this music
To a place I've never been before
General Fiyah, ha
I do this purely for music
No room for hate leave your troubles at the gate
Ya purely cause we have the passion for the music
Now don't ever forget why we do this music
Come and dance up and down
Not for the popularity, money other things
For me there's no mucking 'round
Meanwhile this reggae music takes you to a higher place
I miss around come quick nobody tell me what they think
Watch it man
Never for the money or fame
(it's a funny thing, you know)
Woah, woah woah
(General Fiyah, watch it man!)
Come on
Come join the fun there's room for everyone
To another place I've never been before
Surely music takes me higher
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
The drum and the bass make you move your waist
(Here's another one)
