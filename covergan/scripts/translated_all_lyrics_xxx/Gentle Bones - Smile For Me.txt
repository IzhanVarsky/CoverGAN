You'll see
My dear best friend
There're some things that only you know
And I'll come
And I just it'll be alright
We'll make this our heaven on earth
And trust me
Cause I just know it wil be alright
It's easier on the heart
It's a beautiful night so please don't fall asleep
Wish you live your life in the best way
Smile for me
There is no paradise
Can you see, everything you are?
It's more than they can explain
Come with me
But there will come
And so much more than what you are looking for
We'll open doors that we have yet to explore
When the sun has set
So what is so wrong right now?
You and me, the seven seas
All the love that is in the pain
You'll soon be
A time when you're in the ground
The stars are all we'll ever need
Remember wherever you go
I see us on a boat out on this open sea
When I think of you at some point in the day
