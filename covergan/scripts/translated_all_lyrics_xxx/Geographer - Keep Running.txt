Without knowing the cause
Just keep running on
I built you, palace in my thoughts
Like a fly upon the wall
Then they tell you to crawl
Just keep running on, on, nеver letting up
Then they tell you you're wrong
We aren't here at all
Fear is like a key inside you
First they tell you to walk
But I don't think that's where we below
Someone pulls the lock
Cold against their palm
But I don't think that's where we belong
You're running now
Turn, turn it all into love
Will they ever fall
Just keep running on, on never letting up
Like telling you to fight a war
Wonder have they always been there
Turning in your heart
Even if you could
Wondering where to go
Take away your reasons
Baby it's scary
You follow them into their hearts
First they tell you to learn
Looking down on them
Rising, above it all
Then they tell you to live a lie
They take you for a fool
If you want to live at all
I know that you'll carry
Just keep running on, on, nevеr letting up
You gotta' just keep running on
You don't know where you are
I know that you'll carry me home
Because I know we won't be here for long
Said there's no point in living now
