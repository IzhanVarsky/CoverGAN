And you know you gotta give it to 'em every night
They'll make you mine
They'll change your life
You light up the fire, they just watch it burn
You won't know you're dreamin' until you're awake
We all belong
You're a slave to the rhythm, slave to the light
A gentle violence, they can take their turn
Somewhere to someone
You can't give them somethin' they won't take
