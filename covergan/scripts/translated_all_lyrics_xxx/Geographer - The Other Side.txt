You told me once
Like a story, no one told
We're on our own
And I told you twice
On the other side
I keep the promises you don't make
Love is holy
But I will try
You give it time and then you'll know
(I told you once)
Maybe I was never really yours
Nobody knows where we go when we die
This is all we know
This is all she wrote
(Nobody knows where we go when we die)
It isn't life if you don't have a homе
But you know I'll try
It isn't life if you live it alone
You know I'll try
There's nowhere else to go
Oh on the other side
You get lost in the undertow
You'll try to try out song
But all you wanna do is sing along
I told you once
'Causе love is holy
But you'll lose it forever if you make them pay
'Cause love is holy
And you told me twice
It's still yours if you give it away
(And I told you twice)
To meet you on the other side
It isn't life if you never belong
I will try
