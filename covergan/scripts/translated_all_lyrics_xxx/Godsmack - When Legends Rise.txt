Taking time just one step forward
Legends rise (Legends rise, rise, rise)
It's burning down, it's burning high
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay
Whoa
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
Alone I try with words unspoken
Or just stand there and bleed?
Legends rise (Rise, rise, rise, rise)
When ashes fall the legends rise
You gonna do somethin' about it
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself
Legs are tired, these hands are broken
My throat is dry, my vision's fading
Legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
