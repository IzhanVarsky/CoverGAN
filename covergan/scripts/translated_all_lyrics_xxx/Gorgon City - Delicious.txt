You know I gotta get some more of that, man (Uh)
That was just so delicious (Uh)
But I knew they were still dancing right beneath my knees
And as I feel the sea beneath my knees
Just delicious (Uh)
Just delicious
It was my destiny to devour life like sweets and candy
Recovered wings, took to the sky
That first taste
I could succumb or do it my way
Oh, it's so good
Till I couldn't breathe again (Till I couldn’t breathe again)
Couldn't feel my feet
’Bout an hour passed
My thoughts and conscience oceans deep
It was just so damn delicious
It was just so delicious, man
You know that feeling, right?
This trip, to fall would be defeat
And I was cruising up the highway
Must have been about a half hour delay
You know you got time
Felt the wind at last
Before my conscious mind
But I'll let the waves come over me
I was a million miles away
