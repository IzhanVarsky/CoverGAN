And I know, I know
Go slow, we should take it slow
Let's fall slowly, love
Nothing ever felt this right, but I'm scared
When two broken hearts
On their own, just go slow, yeah
And I don't wanna fuss or fight 'cause it's useless
I just wanna make sure that you're prepared
Admit we're falling, can’t help but let it show
Admit we’re falling, can’t help but let it show
We should let it show
Admit we're falling
You got me thinking, should I let it show?
Can't get through the dark
And I don't wanna live life blind to the bruises
'Cause I've done this before
Admit we're falling, can't help but let it show
All things fall apart
Let's not fall apart
Go, go, we should let it go
