I won't go quietly (Won't go quietly)
Into that ground (Into that ground)
But now I'm done runnin', got another thing comin'
But I never sleep, gotta bury me six feet deep
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
I've been counted out, left for dead
When I go into the ground
Been counted out, left for dead
I've been on the run
Since I was a boy
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down
I'm bringin' my crown (Bringin' my crown)
Oh, they gotta bury me (bury me)
But somehow, someway, I'm-a keep movin' along, movin' along
But I won't get tired, set the town on fire
And when I go into the ground (into that ground)
Say goodnight, I'll never get free
It's only just begun
But somehow, someway, I'ma keep movin' along, along
When I go (When I go)
Oh, they gotta bury me
Where the sun don't shine
Bury me face down
Oh, I've got troubles of more than one kind
Wanted with a bounty on my head
Thinkin' that they've won
Bury me face down (bury me face down)
Oh, I got troubles that won't let me be
There's a whole damn army thinkin' that they're gonna harm me
From the rubble, what do I see?
'Till my troubles got trouble with me
Watch my enemies get destroyed
