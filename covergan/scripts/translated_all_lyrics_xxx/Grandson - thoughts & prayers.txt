No prayers (no prayers)
Heaven's sake
It's murder on the campus
(The silent are damned)
The war is in the street
I think I saw the reaper
The body count is on your hands
Turn off all the lights, nobody make a sound
How much will it take
Nothing gets accomplished
Bulletproof backpacks
The silent are damned
They lobby for the violence
Fear's good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lyin' to the masses
Can bring back what's no longer there
Red all on the canvas
Are we out of time?
Can we turn this all around?
Welcome to my breakdown
They wanna arm the teachers
No thoughts, and no prayers
Money is the motive
(The body count is on your hands)
Will we all fall?
The suit is an accomplice
Cash another payment
(Can bring back what's no longer there)
Smile for the camera
I swear I heard another shot
'Til you get buried in the coffin that you make?
(No thoughts, no prayers)
Another politician bought
No thoughts (no thoughts)
It's a governmental shakedown
The body count is on your hands (on your hands)
Another press conference
(We all fall down)
Watch history repeat
No thoughts, no prayers
No thoughts and no prayers
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
