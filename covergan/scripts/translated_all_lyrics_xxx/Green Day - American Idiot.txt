Don't want a nation under the new media
Information age of hysteria
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
Now everybody do the propaganda
The subliminal mind-fuck America
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
For that's enough to argue
It's calling out to idiot America
All across the alien nation
In television dreams of tomorrow
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
One nation controlled by the media
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
Don't wanna be an American idiot
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
