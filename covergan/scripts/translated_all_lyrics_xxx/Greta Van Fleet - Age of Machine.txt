We need some healing
Plugged in since the womb
Unplug from the source
Oh God, the feeling
Perfect child
God knows if you feel defeated
You have retreated
An omnipresent force
Feeling
For interstellar shores
Heading on a course

Malfunctioned as it grew
Open up the doors
Falling down on you
God machine
In this electric tomb
No more underscores
Prophet of the dune
And the circuits blew
Man has made
