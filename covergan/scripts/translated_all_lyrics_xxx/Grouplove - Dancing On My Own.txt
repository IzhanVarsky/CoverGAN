Yeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself
I'm giving it my all
(I keep dancing on my own)
So far away, but still so near
But you don't see me standing here
I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line
I know where you at, I bet she's around
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
(I just came to say goodbye)
(The lights go on, the music dies)
It's a big black sky over my town
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
Stilettos and broken bottles
I keep dancing on my own
Does she love you better than I can?
Somebody said you got a new friend
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I'm spinning around in circles
