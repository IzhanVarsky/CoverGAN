I just know, I know you're gonna let me out
It's the future and I'm braindead
One, two, three, go
I don't know
No, no
No, no, no, no
Been going on too long, for too long
All this darkness
It turns out you're only a deleter
Am I anxious or just modern?
You're never gonna see them anyway
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And how we built a lighthouse
Take another picture (Picture)
All this time I'm burning with a fever
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no
So bring the pain
Tell your friends that you're okay
We've been here for too long, for too long
Show 'em what you're doing (Doing)
We know it's coming
All this time I thought you were a leader
None of this can live
The world will recover once you put us in the past, yeah
Yeah, I'm destitute, yeah, I feel no roots anymore, anymore
It turns out I've always been my healer
Bring the pain
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Where to go
Nothing really matters anymore, my baby
And the airplanes, and the highways
Yeah, the carwash
Yeah, yeah
Bring the pain, my baby
Out of all these godforsaken ruins
