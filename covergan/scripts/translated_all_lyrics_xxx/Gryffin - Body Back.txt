Don't know why I do this
'Cause it's only me and you that know the truth
Baby, bring your body, baby, bring your
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
They can call me foolish and stupid
'Cause you know they're gonna say it anyway
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
I, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
Who cares what the world's gonna say?
If you want my lovin' you got it anytime you want it
(And I know, and I know that)
Baby, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
I love all the bad things that we do
They don't know 'bout you and I
Who cares if they laugh at what we do?
No, that won't keep us apart
'Cause you know they're gonna think it anyway
Who cares what the world's gonna think?
Baby, bring your body back to me
But, baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish, stupid
Middle finger to the sky
Shut your mouth and put your hands where I want you to (Want you to)
Even though I broke your heart
