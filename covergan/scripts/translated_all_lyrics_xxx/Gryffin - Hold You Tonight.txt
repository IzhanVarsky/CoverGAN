Woah, no, no
All those clothes you're in
The makeup on my pillow
If you were here with me
'Cause everything about you is better in real life
Let me, let me hold you
Yeah, when it's late and I'm lonely
You should use 'em
Reminds me you were there
Let me hold you tonight
I've got hours to give
I'm gonna take my time
Mmm, 'cause I ain't stop thinkin'
Get up out of my head
You got my heart in your hands
Please let me hold you tonight
Can you be on your way?
All those plans you had
Woah, no
So come and fall into my arms
You should lose 'em
And I've had a few drinks
And it just feels right
And let me hold you tonight
Try to tell my friends what you do
Lipstick on the bottle
That you left next to my bed
'Bout last night all day
Make some new ones
And come and fall into my arms
Get up out of my mind
Oh, 'cause this time
It sure hit a lot stronger, baby
Oh, come on
Mmm, are you up, or are you sleepin'?
But it's too hard to describe
