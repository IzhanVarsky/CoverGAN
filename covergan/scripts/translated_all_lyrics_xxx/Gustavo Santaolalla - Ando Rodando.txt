I will interrogate every living thing
heaven, hell
I only have wounds
But of this
on my way searching
I don't care if I don't know
If I don't know what I live for
If the river dies in the sea
I'm going to get the answer
parks, bars
Let's see if it comes out who is the one who lies to us
Signs that make me see
I'm rolling
from the promised land
Beds, trains and places
Open doors
