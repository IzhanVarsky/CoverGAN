Oh, I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
You, yeah, you, why you always trying to bring my mood down?
So I'm here with a brighter perspective
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
Just good vibes, that's what I like (I like)
Be on your merry way
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, good vibes
But the sunshine, it feels like I deserve it
(Good, good, good vibes)
I only want good vibes (Good vibes) 'round me tonight
You, yeah, you, why you coming over here cold as ice?
Why? Why? Boo-hoo, a little optimism can be so nice
I only want
You, yeah, you, why you coming over here with your cloud?
You could chill, you could hang
Throwing venom everywhere daily
No negativity in my life
Maybe, if you wasn't being so shady
So I don't you need you raining on my parade
Just good vibes, that's what I like
But you ain't on that high
So I don't you need you raining (I don't) on my parade (Parade)
I know life will never be perfect
So I really ain't tryna be stressing, ooh
Throwing shade (Shade)
Throwing shade
So I don't you need you raining on my parade (Parade)
