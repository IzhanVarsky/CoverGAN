Just disappear
Tell your brother you're listening to his dreams
Tell your mother you're leaving here
He needs it to be
But most times he just cries to himself
That it's all still there
And you know he won't come around here
Tell your brother you're going away
And this will be the only way
It's like we're losing our sense of home
Tell your mother she is the only one, and your father has made you all that you've become
Sometimes he tries to reassure himself
Sunk deep into his chair
Tell your sister she is all you need
For these words he won't come around here
Tell your mother she needs to reassess herself
'Cause these words aren't meant for anyone else, but your family
And his eyes won't see
And your father has made you all that you've become
It's like something evil is taking a hold, nothing deep here
