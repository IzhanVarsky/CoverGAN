Now you sing in the evening
(It's for celebrating the light that shines through the pane)
The party is so warming
(How do you do that thing you do, that thing you do?)
It's for celebrating the light that shines through the pane
It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane
(How do you do the thing you do, the thing you do?)
You make me want to live again
(You make me want to live again)
A church is not for praying
That is my favourite thing
If you won't answer, who should I ask?
(It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pane)
When you wake me in the morning
Have we registered our love in vain?
A heart is not for breaking
How do you do it?
Have we taken all we're good for?
As it strikes a chord upon my skin
It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin
With the voice that's bouncing like a spring
