Well, there's a ringing in my ears
We've just begun to get it on
I feel the heat, let's cut the lights
I see you move by eleven
But never measure what we've done
When we can just start again (When we can just start again)
Straight to the morning
Not gonna fuss or fight (I'm not gonna fuss or fight)
Straight to the morning (Straight to the morning)
Start all over again
You're always edging up the gears
Start all over again (Straight to the morning)
The fever will never end (The fever will never end)
Follow me, we'll go straight through (Oh)
But there's the devil on my tongue
It's a small slice of heaven
I pick you up at half past ten
Not gonna fuss or fight
You're always never, never, ever stopping
But when I'm with you, it's too much fun
We're going out tonight
Rollin' the dice tonight
Straight through until the break of dawn
We've only just begun
Rolling the dice tonight (Rolling the dice tonight)
Going straight to the morning, yeah, oh
I'm straight to the morning
We're going out tonight (We're going out tonight, alright)
That we might never see the sun
Well, there's a pleasure in this fear
When we can just start again
The fever will never end
Feel like I ain't been out in years
