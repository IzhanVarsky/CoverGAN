I reach in and come undone
New eyes, I need it
I'm easy to come undone
Healing oceans now
Holding out the knot
I’m holding out
You’re open, I hold the Sun
I'm holding out
These hearts are open
Before we bind
Sweetheart, I'm honest
Opened up
You hold your love
I hold down the motions
And reach out in waterfalls
