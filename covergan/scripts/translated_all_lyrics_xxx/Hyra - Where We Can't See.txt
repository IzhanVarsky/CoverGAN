You can back it up into me
The depths we you can’t see, boy
(Down, down, down, down)
And I’ll be sweet to you
Down, down
Focus on us two
I can hold it for a moment
You could stick around as long as I’m there
We could take it slowly
We we can’t see, boy
Here I lie, reminded of your kiss
Tearing my heart to smaller pieces
Hurt my reasoning
Hold it, hold it
So intoxicated, I’m feeling a little weak, oh
Took me away to fantasy, oh
Seeped into my mind
Be real, you liking where it’s going
Far from anything cruel
Slipping further, ten meters deep
Lte me twist it down into the depths
Poisonous, it cuts down on me
