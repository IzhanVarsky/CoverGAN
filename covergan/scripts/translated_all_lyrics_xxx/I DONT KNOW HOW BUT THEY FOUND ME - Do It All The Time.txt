It's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
Get your money from a trust fund
And I'm making her mine
I don't wanna do it, but I'll do it 'cause I do it all the time
And I'm making her mine, I'm making her mine
No reason why
(Do it all the time)
One kiss at a time
I'll be corrupting your mind
No need to cry
And then I'm taking your girl
I'm only doing anything I want to do
We're taking over the world
Now we're so young, but we're probably gonna die
And it's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
A little victimless crime
We look so good and we never even try
Because I do it all the time
Ha!
And when I'm taking your innocence
Do it all the time
