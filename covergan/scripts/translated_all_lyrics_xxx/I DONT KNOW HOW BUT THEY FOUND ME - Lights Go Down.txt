Pardon me if I forget your name
Until the lights go
Down, down
Shake when you haunt me like you were a ghost town
(Steal every heart from the boys that you're touching) Until the lights go down
Dance till the lights go down (Down, down, down, down, down)
Parade through the ballrooms
Is that any way to talk to me?
Oh lord, the thief of the year!
Well, not every hollow is sleepy as this one
Come now
But heads roll just the same
Oh no, what have we here?
Somehow
Corrupting the young with your uncivil tongue
(Oh no, what have we here?) Until the lights go down
Dressed like you're so uptown (Town, town, town, town, town)
And we'll break our necks like we do when the lights go down
Steal every heart from the boys that you're touching
It's curtains for you, join the back of the queue
Until the lights go down
Hello
What a shame if you misspeak now
Decay in your costumes and dance
And dance
Oh lord
(Oh lord, the thief of the year!) Until the lights go down
