To a place where you belong
Sometimes you feel like
And you're in doubt
Live your life and you'll be free
You're down and out
So colourful
Nowhere to go
Open your heart, set your mind at ease
Yeah, Hey, yeah, Uhmm
Don't you worry
If you feel it then let's go
Yeah Hey yeah Uhmm
We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Feeling the pressure
Feeling the lost of control in it's spirit
Uhmmmm uhhm
Keep on rising
And rise, rise, rise
And your feeling low
Keep on rising, rising, rising
Down in the depths of my soul
Rising, rising, rising, rise ohh ohh yeah!
Rise, rise, rise
I know you're gonna
Give it strength to carry on
