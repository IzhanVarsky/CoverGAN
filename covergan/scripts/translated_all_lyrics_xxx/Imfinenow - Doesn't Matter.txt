Do you ever think about me too?
You'd be flying away over and over
Doesn't matter if I try
Walking down this street
I wish you could make mine do that too
Where life is headed to
You'd stick, running when the race is over
You'd stick, running whеn the race is over
I don't know
But I know that it won't be you
Thinkin' 'bout you
To run after you
Even if I did try to reach across to you
How could you just leave?
Where is life is headed to
Doеsn't matter if I try
All those memories
