And everything Iâ€”
'Cause you got everything I want
When we stayed up all night
If you want me to
I'll cross any ocean
Everything that I'm feeling for you
Then baby, I'll go
And everything I need
But I never did
But if you want me to go
Lost track of time
Talking 'bout feelings
Just to be close to you
And everything I need (And everything I need)
Now I wish I was close to you
Just to be close to you (Mmm)
I can say I love you
I wish that I told you
Walk any distance
Do you remember
