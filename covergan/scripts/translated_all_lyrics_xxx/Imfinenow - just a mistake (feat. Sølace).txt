Would you let me
To shelter me from the rain
When I know we were, just a mistake
See some things straight
Why do I dream of you
Never knew it would be so hard
Could you stand next to me?
I can't see past my mistakes
I won't feel the pain
Even when I'm awake
I've been running away from problems
But you cut too deep
Because lately
I knew I would keep
Maybe if I just go to sleep
