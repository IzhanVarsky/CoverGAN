Empathy
Growing cold to the lives we lead
Faces start to feel, unfamiliar
Hold on to you
There isn’t anybody here to help you
So self indulged no one gives a fuck about anyone else
Nothing left but misery
‘Cause everybody’s so afraid to face the truth
Unaware of the hate we feed
Sell your soul to envy and faceless ghosts
Overshadowed by the greed in our own lives
And we’ve been living too long in the fast lane
No more sympathy for the broken
We’re moving too fast too fast too fast
Has never seemed so fucking lost to me
This place is filled with so much hate
Just hold on
Too deep got us being so heartless
In the end you will know you’re nothing
