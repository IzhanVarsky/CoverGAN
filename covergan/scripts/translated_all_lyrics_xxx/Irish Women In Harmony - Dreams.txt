And oh, my dreams
I want more
So understanding and so kind
Never quite as it seems
Is changing everyday
They'll come true
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
La la ya
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
In every possible way
Ah
I know I've felt like this before
Impossible not to do
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me
Is changing every day
And now I tell you openly
Impossible to ignore
Then I open up and see
La ya
Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
Oh, my life
The person falling here is me
It's never quite as it seems
Because it came from you
You're everything to me
But now I'm feeling it even more
You have my heart so don't hurt me
La-ah-ah
A different way to be
