I love the danger (Yeah you do)
Refuse to be serious cause life is a joke
Don’t be a stranger (Hey I won't)
You was a stranger (I know I was)
Who threw me in the moat
I’m the big shot in your life now
Everybody sing
But I think you do
I don’t know a lot but I know what you got
You want my body (Yeah I do)
Who kicked me off the boat
Cause if they find me dead they should know who it be
I’m the one who makes sense
La-da-dada-du-la-dada hey
Let's go!
Yea kid I think you need to take a look in the mirror (Yeah you do)
I put ten sugar cubes in my root beer float
Well now you got me
Hey!
To the gators so I never see nobody later
I want your finger prints all over me
Take that look in the mirror again
I wanted danger (Yeah you did)
Don’t be maybe baby come on I’m the big shot
And you said you never knew me
You always did, Kid, you know it’s true
