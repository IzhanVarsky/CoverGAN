And forever isn't permanent, it's 'til I change my mеntal
Every day, I wish I could wake up to the sunlight creeping in
Until I get a chance to judge LA bеyond the weather
Then I might lose the drive to make the art from pure expression
How're you feeling? How're you keeping yourself busy?
The somethings wanna keep it where the passion is
I'll probably never, I don't wanna sever
I create the window and I paint the view
Cuz part of me is thinking all this madness is a catalyst
But keep me guessing, cuz if I learn the lesson
I'm hoping by the summer we can gather all together
In the night, I dim the lights
(Tremor when you're waiting for a winner)
The separation of our loving
When the world spins again
But I can't have the neighbors watch me sleeping in
Every day, when I wake
Every night, I become a fractal in the cloud that we're thinking through
Are you keeping yourself busy?
It's all love, but I'll have priorities forever
Hoping I can plan instead of hoping for the better
If I can't keep, keep in touch now
Don't forget the feeling of the tremor that we all felt coming
