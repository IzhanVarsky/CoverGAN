Cause oh, I feel nothing
And oh here’s to nothing
They took another red brick dream
Have you heard about it
For the modest cold suburbia we know
And that gets tangled in the wind
Chorus
When I’m out here on the wrong side of the road
And oh, you’re a ribbon
Said a prayer to get my hopes up
I said a couple things that I regret
But if you’re gone when I get off the road again
But thеy get twisted in the wind
Verse
How we lost someone
Of the modest cold suburbia we know
And oh I feel nothing
Was on the Northside driving in
Then you know I only wish that you were therе
Of a modest cold suburbia we know
I want to call you call you, call you back
