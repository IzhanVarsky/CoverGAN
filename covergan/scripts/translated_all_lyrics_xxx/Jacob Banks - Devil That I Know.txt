Standin' eye to eye
So we came forward, runnin' backwards
And, oh, what a way to die
Somеhow we made it, although jaded
Overdosin', at least I'm with my baby
But we're still chasin' for that feeling
Somehow we made it, although jaded
Was it worth it all? Could it be more?
We came forward, runnin' backwards
No one man's a island, shotgun ridin' for ya
Was it worth it all? Could it bе more?
And, oh, the devil that I know is better than the devil that I don't
We can't get any higher, we can't get past Messiah
Pretendin' we're alive as we grow colder
