Is resolve overrated or needed again?
So you came in with me now you’re leaving with them
It’s like saying hello to what I’d like
You just caught those feelings and wished them well
They can’t see anybody else
I’m saying not tonight
Fell off of the map
I won’t be impressed in and out of thought
I won’t be impressed in and out of conscience
What the words don’t show when you’re on a lap
Honey you’ll keep calling me back
Hold the phone without saying hello
Are the seas only flowing to your knees?
Couldn’t see them where they ride
Cus I know
It’s like saying hello
Are you caught up in the middle of the tides?
I know
