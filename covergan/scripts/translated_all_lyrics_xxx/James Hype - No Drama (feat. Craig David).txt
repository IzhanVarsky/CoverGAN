Every bit of that drama
'Cause love is never simple
That love is never simple
Talking
You've been reflecting, counting blessings
No matter high or low
But trust me, girl, we'll be fine, yeah
I've been reflecting my perspective
Oh, we've all been hurt before, yeah
To a different tempo
And now you know
It could just be an echo
The sun ain't always shining
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
We don't need
When the night falls on us one by one we will forget
And now I know
No matter where it goes
We don't need no drama, don't need problems in my head
You told me your heart broke
Dancing
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
We gotta take things slow
The things we gon' forget
And if it brings you pain then it's okay for you to let go
The problems in my head
A dance with me instead
We don't need no drama, dance with my body instead
In a different lingo
