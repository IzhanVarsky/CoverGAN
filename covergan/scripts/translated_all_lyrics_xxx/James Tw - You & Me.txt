You don't even realise what you mean
You don't even realise (Oh-oh-oh)
You don't even realise what you mean (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh, I want you, you, you
I wouldn't have nothing at all
(Oh-oh-oh)
No one could fall for you quite like me
As long as I got you and me
I didn't mean to hurt you
Stories on the tip of our tongues
You and me, you and me
You say that you don't know me
Moving through this world as a two-man team
And me, me, me, together (You and me, you and me)
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes
You don’t even realise (Oh-oh-oh)
No one could get me so perfectly
So why’d I let you walk out the door?
We'll look back and laugh
'Cause if I didn't have you
'Cause I want you, you, you
Remembering when we fell in love
’Cause I want you and me, you and me
Me, me, me, forever (Oh-oh-oh)
No one could fall for you quite like me (Oh-oh-oh)
And me, me, me, forever (You and me, you and me)
You’re all that I need
I always forget that you can't read my mind
All of the broken hearts and the stupid mistakes
You don't know who I am anymore
I know one day we'll look back
Have got us to where we are, it was worth all the pain
I'll always have everything I need
Me, me, me, together
You and me, you and me (Oh-oh-oh)
No one could get me so perfectly (Oh-oh-oh)
You're all that I need
Yeah, we’ll look back
Then you wouldn’t feel insecure
A library full of pages
But if you knew the truth, then
