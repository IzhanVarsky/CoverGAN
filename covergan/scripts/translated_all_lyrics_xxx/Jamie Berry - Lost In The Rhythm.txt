Swing to the sound
Heartbeats beatin' and the crowd
Not once did he ever leave my side
Dancing, waiting for that drop as we
Our feet tap-tappin' and our heartbeats beatin' and we
There's a boy downtown from the club I know
Spin 'round and-
His feet like magic, then he looked my way
I knew I was in for a ride, as we-
That guy sure knows how to twist and jive
Spin 'round and 'round
I moved to the fours as he danced away
Boy, I'll tell ya: that boy can move
Never knew I'd feel so alive
We'd be dancing 'til the dawn
No matter what, we couldn't stop
He doesn't say a word, just hits the floor
Got me twistin' and turnin' around in my Jimmy Choos
The way he moves always caught my eye
With our heartbeats beatin' and we
We'd be dancing, dancing, dancing 'til the dawn
And in one swoop, he had my by his side
We got lost in the rhythm, the lights, and the crowd
(Drop)
I swayed around the club all night
Couldn't take no more, just had to try
That look in his eyes made me sure
