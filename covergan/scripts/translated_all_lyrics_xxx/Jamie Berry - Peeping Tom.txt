So, I slide across my hood, and what do I see?
...so, just to keep everybody awake, sort of, I asked a couple of the boys in the band to drop over, too...)
What do you see?
So, I simply, accidentally, carelessly
Open up your eyes real wide
What do you see, what do- what do you see?
He's been there for days
There's a Peeping Tom sat outside my window
Sure as hell, the Peeping Tom is looking at me
'Cause Peeping Tom I've got a big surprise
(...and we had to have music... I mean you wouldn't want things to get dreary, would you?
So, Peeping Tom, keep on looking at me
Time to play
And I think it's time to play
Peeping Tom tell me
Drop my dressing gown for him to see
Peeping Tom tell meâ€”
'Cause Peeping Tom, I've got a big surprise
'Cause there is nothing more that I like than to be seen
And now it's only gone and gotten onto Sunday
What do you see? (anything can happen, watch)
