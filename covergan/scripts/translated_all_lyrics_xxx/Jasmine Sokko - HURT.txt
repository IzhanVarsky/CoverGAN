I know you know my weakness
Of apology, 'cause that is free
Yeah, I know how we are
But you blame it on insecurities (insecurities)
I just
So I guess there's a glitch in transaction
The things that pull me down
So I came to you to cry about
I know I'm kind of selfish
Some kind of miscalculation
But I didn't think I need affection
Haven't been doing good for a while
See I wish I was calm
I just, I just, I just, I just
So I guess there's glitch in transaction
Like haze getting
Baby, I am sorry
Poisons darts right of my chest (right of my chest)
You said you meant me well with your affection
But you didn't have to rub it in right now to remind me
You see, I know, I know
Hurt you back
But I just need somebody (need somebody)
I just want to hurt you back
I just (hurt you back)
And I like your honesty
Spilling words
