Or a beautiful sunrise
No, I won't give up
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)
God knows we're worth it
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
Even if the skies get rough
'Cause even the stars, they burn
To be right where you are
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
I see that you've come so far
To see what you find
Some even fall to the earth
Well, there's so much they hold
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
When I look into your eyes
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
I'm giving you all my love
And when you're needing your space
And just like them old stars
Well, I won't give up on us
We got a lot to learn
I won't give up on us
And who I am
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I'm still looking up
How old is your soul?
It's like watching the night sky
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
We've got a lot to learn
God knows I'm tough enough
