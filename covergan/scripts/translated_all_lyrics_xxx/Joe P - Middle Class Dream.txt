Right past my eyes
And don't you wonder why it never rains anymore?
In the movie, you're the love scene where the camera shows you nothing
Where the streetlights never light up that's where we'd come, I bet he won't know what that's like
God I wish I know what that's like
And don't you wonder how this doesn't hurt like before?
But if you let me, I could blend into the background every weekend
We're living a middle-class dream
Safe from it all
We're stuck in our middle-class dream
Find shelter, take cover from me
I'm her first time, I bet he won't know what that's like
And he's the champagne and your headache that you can't shake
I bet you don't know what that's like
Right through my bones
I'm just a fly on the wall and I see it all
The cold blows through my window
In the backseat of your fresh car
You stay dry all year
The sunshine comes through my blinds
I'd be a fly on the wall
I'm the suburbs, she's the city where you're living
