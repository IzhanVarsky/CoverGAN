Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
They're just hopelessly gazing
Even in the shadows
Nobody sees what we see
You can turn my lights out
Oh, baby, love me lights out
Your love is bright as ever
Giving you everything
Is all that I see
Your face is all that I see
And I'm crashing into you
In the darkest night, I'll
Baby, love me lights out
Before time has run out
Baby, daylight's wasting
Mhh baby, kiss me, kiss me
Oh, in the darkest night, I'll
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
I'm giving you everything
Oh, baby, take me, take me
You kill me girl XO
Oh, you can turn my lights out
Before our time has run out, oh
I'll search through the crowd
Baby, kiss me
Oh, we don't have forever
You better kiss me
