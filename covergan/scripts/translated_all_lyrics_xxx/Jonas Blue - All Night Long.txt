Even though we're strangers in the dark, you're all I need
And I won't leave
Catch a feeling, carry on
'Cause I'll be with you all night long
Slow down, yeah
I, know that I love it when we're high
Look at me
Lately I been thinking 'bout the way you looked at me
Free falling
Sleepwalking
Keep believing, carry on, on, on, on
