I said, "Hey Larry man, yes its been a real long time"
And that was that and Larry and the whole team off they flew
Of Fantastic- erotica and doing something mean
But then I realize my trousers feel much lighter than before
Until I found myself a-standin’ where the sun don’t seem to shine
Suddenly I’m sitting in the belly of the beast
It must have been my ego that had blinded me to see
I tell the beastly brothers that I mean no one no harm
I grab my shoes and jacket and start to walk out the door
He said, "Oh, Jonny, baby, could you maybe spare a dime?"
Despite the lack of sunlight the reality was clear
But I come back resurrected times better than before
So I just kept a-walking or feet at a time
A monumental roar that knocked me flat out on my ass
Now with one eye split wide open and women on one arm
That I’d been bested by the one and only number
I yelled up to the heavens and the heavens yelled right back
I said, "I’m sorry Lar’ but I just don’t carry that kind of cash
I feel like saying something, but before I get to speak
He said, "Okay I understand, I’ve picked up on your clue"
Not since the great depression and that whole stock market crash"
Larry Bird really pulled the wool over me, uh huh
I’m upside down and bleeding, cut wide open cheek to cheek
The beast and all his brothers are just staring back at me
I’m not intending to offend I’m simply trying to set the scene
So there I was just walking down the middle of the street
When in flies Larry Bird and the ’ All Star Team
I was currently residing halfway up somebody’s rear
Oh will someone please just stop me ‘fore I say something obscene
I am somewhere in between the silver surfer’s dreams
They do the sacrificial dance and feed me to the boar
