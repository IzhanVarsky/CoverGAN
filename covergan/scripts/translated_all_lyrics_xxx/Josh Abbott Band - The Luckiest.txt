And I'm lucky for the miles on my boots
I don't wanna know what it's like
I'm lucky God made Friday nights and cold beer
And I'm lucky King George still makes country records
For all my stars to line up like this
'Cause now that I've kissed your lips goodnight
Loved by you (I'm the luckiest)
And I'm lucky I got friends that got my back
Somewhere along the way in another life?
I feel the luckiest to be loved by you (Ooh)
Loved by you
I swear, sometimes, it feels just like I'm dreaming
Did I meet a genie in a bottle?
And I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
Yeah, I'm lucky (I'm lucky), and I know it's true
But I feel the luckiest to be loved by you
Yeah, I'm lucky, and I know it's true
And if I am, please don't wake me up
I'm lucky King George still makes country records
'Cause I don't know what I did
I can't believe the life that I've been given
To be without your so good kind of love
I'm lucky that I come from where I come from
Yeah, I'm lucky, I know it's true
Did I make the same wish all three times?
And that I've had all the good times that I've had
Did I find a field of four-leaf clovers
