Up, down, I'm so insane from what you've put me through
At least weâ€™re dying together
I-I-I-I got no control, I'd rather die than let you (Go)
I-I-I-I got not control, I'd rather die than let you go
I've tried too many times, too many times, yeah
They say that time makes it better
But if this love's gonna kill us
(Verse )
I-I-I-I got no control, I roll the dice and risk it all
And change our minds like the weather
At least we're dying together
I've tried so many times, I just can't get enough
Then wake up wearing my sweater
Somethin' 'bout you, I'm a addict
Oh well, I think you made me crazier than you
We fall in love like the summer
Leave you 'til I forget how bad you fucked me up
But shit, it's taking forever
Damn these bipolar hearts always feelin' too much
You come over just to break up
Hate you, I need you, we're so problematic, yeah
