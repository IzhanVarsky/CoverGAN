I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I'm sad
Never left the house, we was always stuck
I'm on a stairway to Heaven
I'm happy, I’m happy, happiest when I'm sad
Maybe we were cursed, maybe we were magic
I heard you moved home, hope you're doing better
The secrets I still never tell
My parents hated ya more than all the drugs (Yeah)
And I don't like the way it feels
Still bad that we stopped it
I like you most in the madness (Yeah)
Most times you would cry out your make up
Make love, still drunk when we wake up
Keeping up with you, it was toxic (Yeah)
I’m happy, I'm happy, happiest when I’m sad (Yeah)
I've been sober for a minute now
Summertime, every night we would break up
It ain't real if it's average, yeah
'Cause I know how much you love
Missing the way you give me hell
Lost a lot of friends just to keep ya
I miss us living on your couch
So you found a nice guy? Hate to see you settle (Yeah)
I'm happy, I'm happy, happiest when I’m sad
Getting high off your sister's pills
To cry out your name
It's only good when it’s tragic
The stupid shit we fight about
