Waste away the days, burn away the nights
Double up the dose (Double up the dose)
Pedal to the floor and I got no brakes (Brakes)
Double up the dose, let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride
Found our broken hearts, lost our fucking minds
Do or die, you and I, we'll try everything
Push me to the edge, I know what you like
Mixin' things, we shouldn't be
Had 'em high hopes, now I'm losin' my faith (Faith, yeah)
Psychadelic love, dancing through the night
'Til heaven come, it's you and me
Head up to the floor and I got no brakes (Brakes)
'Til heaven come
Smoke it 'til it's gone, nothing goes to waste (Waste)
'Til heaven comes
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
You're my favorite drug, you're my favorite high
'Til heaven come, don't you fall asleep
Oh-oh, oh-oh
My faith (Yeah), but baby
Empty fantasies, yeah, feed your appetite
That's my fucking girl, we them crazy types
