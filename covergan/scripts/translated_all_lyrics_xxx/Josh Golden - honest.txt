That you're gonna read it and not reply
Your love is all that I wanted
I should've tried to change your mind
Fake another smile and just wonder why
I keep lying to myself that it's better this way
How we danced to Tiny Dancer all around your room
Staying in every night (Uh)
Never knew what I could lose (Uh)
I hate not being around you, what did we prove?
Until I spent a month without you
Damn it, girl, it hurts my pride (Uh)
I'm scared that you don't miss me
But it's useless 'cause the truth is
After all this time, you still don't miss me
I miss the drunken nights with you (Yeah)
Thinkin' that I'm gonna text you
Bottle up our emotions
We had to jump to assumptions
I don't know how I can stop it
I keep lying to your friends, saying I'm doing great
All this time without you got me stuck in lying games
I loved you, I loved you, honest
'Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna see you
That I loved you, I loved you, honest
I hope that you still remember
