Or have you already read my mind?
I have been so long alone
Haven't seen you in the longest time
Heaven knows how hard I'm trying
So patience, please have patience
I can't feel those storm clouds roll in
Can you give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
I ain't got those kind of bones
You and I been strangers
Can I tell you how I'm feeling
I don't know how to do this
Patience, please have patience
