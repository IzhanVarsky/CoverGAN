I saw it on Rio Bravo
And told his tale to Colorado
Spent the night on the face of the earth
I’d had enough of trouble
Sometimes, it's a losing battle
Drifted down to Tennessee
Got lost in the caves of virtue
Fed it on my sins and apples
Now I'm trying to mend my ways
I gave up my only twin
He held the notes like rock 'n roll
Born again into lost belief
I kept it in a box of wood
Blame the maker but stay with me
From the apple tree, I ripped a snake
Sometimes the righteous win
I had enough of pain and bad will
It's always been in my nature to be the beast
Good enough for you someday
It was poison but I knew of its worth
Fell into a den of thieves
I turned my face to the world of shadows
There was nothing to forgive her
Till then, it's a losing battle
That's when trouble spoke
Most times, it’s a losing battle
Lost my heart to a girl of silver
Lost man singing for his soul
She was trying to be free
By the time the fever broke
Tried to do the things I should
Without a friend till the day I met you
Swam naked in the mythic lake
