As if I could escape you
You took my only boy away
Drank the water from the stream
The soles of both my feet were bruised
There's only me alone tonight
A land that beckoned like a friend
With every breath, it hurts me
And hoped it would not kill us
A simpler time, a simpler place
Your family close around your bed
To welcome them with mercy
The river stole away my shoes
All we had for a cargo truck
I'd rather die than take it
All alone in a tiny cell
We left everything behind
You won't say where he's gone to
Who crawled the final brutal miles
Through blood and filth and rock and wild
And you who watched from your great gates
With others who had even less
The holy family got away
Then took our pride and stole our babes
And since I could not hold my babe
But as you rest your weary head
Watched us as we met our fates
And may it follow you to hell
That’s where I buried Joseph
In the hopes of only living
A hammer on an anvil sky
His dreams were deep and soundless
'Til finally all we had were dreams
My boy is gone and I don't know
A man offered a change of luck
Put handcuffs tight around my wrists
Now Joseph's dead out on the road
You will one day die of something
And though I plead and though I beg
If I had the chance again
Took only what we had to keep
He found me there where I had slipped
I’m tired now, my eyes are dry
And Egypt stretched out its great hand
We left our home by dark of night
Joseph and my boy and I
My boy lay silent in my arms
The day was long, the sun was high
Ours if we could make it
May the pain within you dwell
Forever unforgiven
They shut the door behind us
In a land I thought would be
It got so hot we could not breathe
And we hoped that they would fill us
By the wall I fell and cried
Shackles tied around my legs
To the ones who you gave nothing
May your thoughts all fly instead
With fifty others in the back
The naked one, the starving child
We slipped into the forest
A land that welcomes strangers in
Where he is or where I am
We lived on roots and the bark of trees
We prayed our prayers, we broke our bread
When all the gunmen were asleep
For death was all around us
In the hopes they would not find us
When we arrived, the sky was black
Joseph and my boy and me
