I'll bury you here under the sweet grass
All round the dark said
At the bottom of the hill
That kiss all your limbs
All round the light said
I was a man of high renown
Cover me in elephant
Where I held you underneath
Cover me in elephant oil
You were a man of noble esteem
Before the towers fell
My burnt and bony knees
Older in the doorway
That sticks to your thighs
Older in the roses
I dreamt we were in hell
I was a man of noble esteem
And the sisters I had too
Younger in the roses
When the muddy rockets flew
Where the goats are on patrol
Cover you in petrol and tires
I'll bury you here
The rush all down your back
Bury me here under the sweet grass
To see your eyes all black
The dusty garage floor
Along your soft skin torn
Under the sun beams
