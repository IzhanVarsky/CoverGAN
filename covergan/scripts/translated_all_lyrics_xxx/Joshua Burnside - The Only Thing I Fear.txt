Peace in my soul
Tigers in the garden
Oh, when the day is dying
Well, I just can't find
Yeah, the only thing I fear is myself
Always feel a presence lurking
Well, I don't know what I did last night
Faces in the TV static
And the only thing I fear is myself
Oh, when I was younger
Behind the curtain
Forward as the weather vane
I take my potion
Now that I am older
No, I just can't find it
Will boil the blood inside your stomach
Ghosts under the stairs and
There's thunder in my head
And my parents were out working
Hear voices in the attic
To make you run a mile from me
But careful friend, this useful tonic
Yeah, the voices in the attic were mine
That everything is moving
Under my bed
The only thing I fear is myself
Well, this persistent illusion
And float above that endless ocean
It spins, spins, spins
I don't know what I said
