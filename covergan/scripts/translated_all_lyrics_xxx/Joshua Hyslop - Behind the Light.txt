In my heart, I, I know I've played the fool
There is something here to behold
And the whole time, I wondered where you are
Oh, the summers that never end
But, alone is harder than I thought
No, it's not that I spoke in vain
Crimson sunsets and violet skies
So, here I go again
Well, there is something I can't explain
Oh, giving more than I've got
As the light fell underneath the dark
More than I have got
Now it's over
But I still don't seem to understand
I remember the sweeter days
Something burning behind the light
But it was alright when I was playin' it for you
Just my words never came out right
There is more here than meets the eye
Mixed with amber and waves of gold
Diving headlong below the waves
As they break, the horizon bends
