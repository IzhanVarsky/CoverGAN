Raise your hands
Singin' hallelujah, I'm known and loved
I hope you see someday that you are beautiful anyway
They told you it's clinical, but I seem so critical
Trust me, know I get it
You hate yourself and anxiety
Take a second and breathe in
Most the days and that's okay
Feeling so broken and alone
You look in the mirror
But I won't agree when you tell me you don't deserve a life
That you keep on believing were a lie
You can be scientific
And you never gave in on those days
And away you fly
'Cause you never let up the fight
You walk with your head held so low
And horribly awful
Free with your head held so high
You'd open up and open wide with a smile
There you go
I wish I could convince the thoughts
You told me the other day
In the pain
You wanna give in
Depressed, a mess to death
Please try to see it clearer
That's what makes this life so wonderfully awesome
Yet somehow, it's beautiful anyway
Singin' I'm here for a reason
How crazy and amazing you are and then let it inside
