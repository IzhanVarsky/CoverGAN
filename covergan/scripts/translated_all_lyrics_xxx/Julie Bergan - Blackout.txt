Already lost me, I'm outta here
We had it all, but
Get out of my mind, yeah)
Pack up, move on, forget
It's how I want it
Wrap it up, seal it up
This is how we do it, now
It came to show
This is how I want it
There's so much talking, but I don't care
I've had enough now
I know you know it
(Right out of my head)
Won't take this anymore
This is how we do it
(I'll leave it behind, out of my mind
Out of my head and thoughts
This is how I want it, now
I need a, I need a, I need a
(Pack up, move on, forget)
Look where it started
Blackout
Throw it out the window now
Right out of my head
In your ego
(Erase and rewind, out of my mind
Gonna switch you off
You were too caught up
This is how we do it now
It's how we do it
