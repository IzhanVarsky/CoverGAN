I'm alright but all my friends are dead
The days are always numbered
Drifting on a parallel to mine
Way out
Now to pull the knife
What's the bigger lie?
Stuck in the screen forever
Behind the eyes, I see them
I'm swallowed by the moon, yeah
But it goes on and on and on
Inside, I've been to nowhere
Reading from the window by my bed
In my world
Just to show the scars that're on the spine
I won't betray the system
