Night is old the day is behind us
She said why don't you know how I feel?
I wanna go
Lock up the island and swim from the shore
I don't seem to know my face anymore
How the hell should I know?
But troubles in bed, with the dark
You know
I wanna' go home
But god only knows what I feel isn't real
She's far in the eyes and it's starting to show
Fuck up the party, let it all go
Smash all the windows, tear up the floor
Leave the island as it is
And the hair that you pulled from its head
(mmm) I wanna go home
Talking strangers faded in darkness
And I can't bare one more day in the office
Cause' I know I wanna go home
And I can't handle the weight on my shoulders
One... Two...
It will blow your mind
And isn't it lovely to be alone?
Pray that the violence stays at the door
Isn't it lovely to be alone?
Honestly
After all, All I know is I wanna' go home
