You got trouble to share
I'm not going nowhere (Call me up)
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind (I'm not going nowhere)
I'm not going nowhere
I'm never going nowhere (I'm not going nowhere)
And I'm getting worried about you
'Cause I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth (Call me up)
Call me up (Call me up), give me a piece of your mind
Call me up (If you're feeling low) if you're feeling low
Are you filling in a crossword, or are you whittling a chess set
I got nothing but time
So many people trying to kill time
I got nothing but time (Nowhere)
I'm getting lost in the red tones (Yeah)
I can't believe it's not dead yet
I'm never going nowhere (I'm not going)
Call me up if you're feeling low
Because I can't tell if you're telling me the whole truth
I've been here on my Jack Jones
Call me up, give me a piece of your mind
I'm never going nowhere
I'm never going nowhere (Going nowhere)
Another world in my headphones (Yeah)
Only another ghost in a ghost town
And everything I could have told you
It never seemed to be the right time
Steady waiting by the bat phone
About everything that's going on with you anyway
I keep thinking of the old you
Twenty-eight days later (Ooh)
Now it's forgotten like a cold brew
You got trouble to share (Low)
Or are you hiding from the neighbours (Neighbours)
Call me up (Call me up) if you're feeling low (Yeah)
I'm not going nowhere (If you're feeling)
How you dealing with the distance (Distance)
