Fools are staying for the winter
Even if you find that you’re a clone
Even if you’re basically alone
Even if you’re basically a clone
Riding on a snow white stallion singing
Money never knows it’s history
Fell in love with it in summer
Trying to keep the wolves at bay
Feeling like the night was day
Hardly a hint of the aftermath
Room like a star-spangled galaxy spinning
Just walking around with a white moustache
Don’t ever wipe that smile off your mouth
Everything I’ve ever done or seen
Buying what we sell we can all make a killing
Even if you find yourself alone
Moon like a silver medallion swinging
Ain’t it good to know you’re alive and willing
Room like an old black spinning
Ain’t it good to know you’re alive and winning
Of everything I’ve ever done or seen
Money never knows where it’s been
Suger-coated shell with the heartbreak filling
In a friend of a friend’s house
