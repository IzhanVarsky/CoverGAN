Night you'll never forget
Fendi, gucci and dior
Hoe, haha
Body rarri, yeah, a couple thousand on it
Damn, I'll blow up, owned a two-seat (coupe)
Spilled a thousand on my motherfucking new jeans
I'm addicted to your pussy
Squeeze-in your belly
You'll beg me for it
(baby, turn me on)
You ruined many of them, I'm just one too many
Te quiero, mi pecado
Yes, fold it, hoe, girl I want it all
Baby I ain't got no plot
I'm just trynna fuck you, mami
All the good shit on me
On and on and on, on and on it, yeah
Lil shawty way too hot
Ah, honey, Hani, ah, hadi, hard it up
I just let her play on top
I know you're a baddie
All these hundreds, hundred thousand heartbeats
Aye, just walk, own the shit
Diablo in love, god I love that body
Coke on gucci, sort on gucci
(Bitch)
Turn your daddy on, burn the way you want
Mami soy el diablo
One touch and you'll forfeit
Now you'd do anything, for me
Zara, claro
Yo necesito malo
