with good people
Did we also fall in love someday?
I let go of the easily held hand
I'm fine, how are you?
Those memories that made me sick
so can i laugh here
We only separated and changed
you'll be busy as usual
live like that
I hope it can
Isn't it surprising
We were happy because we were together
Will it be beautiful for you now?
It's still you
we were young then
We were hugged all day, have you ever drawn the end?
What kind of dream did you and I have together
