Show them one more time
Wrong she did at the time
That I can bring tears
Read me my rights
Guilt-free
Guilt-free, guilt-free
The rain keeps me indoor
They got no friend in me
When I open up the window
I guess we're never meant to be
To their eyes
Ocean eyes, clear blue sky
But she's in pain
Prove to those with spite
Baby, I'm guilty
Told me 'bout her life
You should stay
I got enemies
Baby, I'm guilty...
I still hear the echoes
(Echo, echo, echo, echo)
Can't predict which way the wind blows
Oh wait, oh wait
'Cause I'm no saint
I can hear the echoes when I sleep at night
I should leave
Echo, echo, echo, echo...
'Cause baby I'm guilty
Don't let go
I see the signs, but they are sticking through the silence
That how she missed being in this arms
