Like all the ones I had before
Home alone and I'm waiting for someone who never shows up!
Appointments, you've been breaking 'em all
But I always end up still wanting you
No one can say I didn't try
I am forever alone
You're only giving me drips of your love
Why would you ever put me first?
Tried everything to make you feel what I feel
Why do I do this to myself?
It's like a never ending story
When you're not I don't even exist
If I ask you if you want to hang with me
You got a thousand excuses rehearsed
And now you're slipping away
I give, and you take, and I give
I tried to find someone new
My love for you
Well, I guess I pushed too hard
When I'm with you, you tell me you love me
But when you're drunk and got no place to hide
Is stopping you from being you
But did you ever think about me when I wasn't near you?
You shine best without me
When I held your hand you were sincere
You are second to none
I wanted to leave
And I'm lonely, I'm angry, I'm tired
Who's the one you always call?
Home alone eating sushi for two
Feels like my love for you
