And we’re walking, car parked in the shade of the trees
Tried to climb one, countryside activities
And we’re walking, a woman and her dog look away
Don’t make a sound
And we’re walking, palms are sweating, our hands let go
And we’re walking, talk about The Galapagos
Wade in the water on your own, don’t wanna go home
Natural science, erosion, eruption and us
Keep on talking, self-conscious but it’s not gonna show
Leave clothes and shoes on the ground, don’t make a sound
Nod at the locals, knowing that we’re not going to stay
