And it comes as no surprise
I swear you make me high
Higher for every turn
So you don't play around
I got not her
Fire, fire, burn, burn
I am serious
About the places you take me
Higher, for every turn
I don't care if all is a lie
And it's Moonshine
Swing around...
Swing around... around, around...
Fire, oh oh oh
Burn, burn, burn, burn
And we are dancing around
Can you look me in the eyes
Higher, higher, burn burn
I wanna be something funny
Baby, you make me delirious
On your mind
I'm blue eyes
I can come along, for a ride
More than twice
Into the wild side of my mind
Fire, oh
Moonshine
I've been around the block
Somebody should warm me
