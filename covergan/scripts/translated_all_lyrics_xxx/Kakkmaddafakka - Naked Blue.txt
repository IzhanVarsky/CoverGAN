Swimming naked with you
There's a climate change
Navigation isn't easy
Music plays from the local star's guitar
And you grab my hand and we jump in the water
And me, I guess I never revealed my intention
Adventure into space
I say don't go too far
Since we were fifteen you've been hanging around
Naked in the blue
But I'm with you and you're ordering a double
And you look nice and warm
My best friends told me I should stay out of trouble
My life has been a snowstorm
You look at me differently today
Me and you and only water
Down at the local bar
You tell me you're a wandering star
I'm cold and freezing
Joked around through ups and downs
You say you're leaving this place
But tonight I can't help giving you all my attention
