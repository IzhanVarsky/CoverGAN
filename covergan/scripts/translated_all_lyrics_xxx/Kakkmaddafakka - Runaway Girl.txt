I can see it in your eyes
Guilty love
The rumor say you took someone from another one
Another broken heart
The rumor say you got one
Looking out the window there is a full moon, full moon
You say you walk the line
But we’re halfway around the world
Hiding conversations in the backseat
Stole someone from another woman
Arranging secret meetings in the bathroom
Room in your hotel
When I f*** you from behind
Runaway girl, run away girl
You need it for your art
You need another story
Marathon woman. They can’t catch you
Say have we crossed the border
Hey baby there is a full moon
Another glass of wine
Marathon woman
Runaway girl run away girl
Runaway girl
Hey baby there is a full moon, full moon
You made me promise that I won’t tell
