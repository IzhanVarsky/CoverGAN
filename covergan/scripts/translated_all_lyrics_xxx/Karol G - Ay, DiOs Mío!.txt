Ovy On The Drums
Stop looking at him (Ah), and he made me (And he made me, oh)
That he wants to have sex with me, eh (eh)
I couldn't, no (No), tell her no
Your man wrote to me (Oh), and told me (To me)
And I told him: "Oh, my God, how delicious, my God"
"Oh, my God, how delicious"
When I left he sent for me (Oh)
Then he told me (Oh) that he liked me (-tea me)
And I told him: "Oh, my God, how delicious, my God" (Ah)
That he liked all of my songs (Eh, eh)
I told him "slow", and he made me tra-tra
And in your eyes I noticed it
That he wants to have sex with me, eh (eh, eh, ah)
I know he noticed it and I couldn't help it
that you wanted and me too
I wasn't looking for you, babe
Your man wrote to me (Oh), and he told me (To me)
And I couldn't, no (no), tell her no
Between bottles of Ros√©
A little dog of that' very abnormal (Mmm-mmm)
Oh, my God, how rich, my God
He invited me to go out dancing (Ah-ah)
It was a thing that I don't know
I couldn't, no, tell her no (No)
we were warming up
That he wants to have sex with me, huh
But when we meet, baby
"Oh, my God, how rich" (How rich)
"Oh, my God, how delicious, my God" (Mmm)
He pulled me and told me: "Come here" (Oh; ah)
you were conquering me
"Oh, my God, how delicious, my God" (Yeh)
