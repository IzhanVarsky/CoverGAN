Leave the winter on the ground
Lay a whisper on my pillow
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day
I wake up lonely, is there a silence
I dream away...
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
But in and outside I turn to water
In the bedroom and all around
That I'm sheltered by your heart
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
Touch me now, I close my eyes
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
And dream away...
Make believing we're together
