Make the fucking hell shape
We’re just young, numb and broke
They were oh so funny
You just wanna be lucky
Think I can feel my legs shake
When your daddy’s got money?
I’m brand new baby
That’s why I need these narcotics
And make the fucking hell right now
Don’t take me away from this feeling now
But you don’t wanna be saved
I used to drive down to you
I was hoping I’d find myself
She's oh, so, lucky
Yeah
I think I can feel my legs shake
Brand new baby, born at
(kid brunswick)
We lived miles apart
Oh right now
Fuck, Off
And you took my money
Have you got a reason to be sad
When the tears came running
When that addy was the topic
I was hoping I’d
We just wanna be lucky
When I could call you my babe
Do you remember those days?
With a pocket full of dynamite
Go on, make the fucking hell
I was hoping I’d find myself;
But waves kept coming
What do you wanna get away from now
Yeah she’s a rich little girl
I guess that, I’m only real in my head
I could call you my honey
But we don’t wanna be saved
What d’you wanna get away from?
Hoping I’d
(wanna be lucky, wanna be lucky)
Well, you held my hand
‘Cos she’s a rich little girl
And I held you in my arms
(ooooh)
She better keep runnin’
What the fuck you want?
And she’s oh so lucky
As you took it all from me
Make the fucking hell right now
(mmmm)
