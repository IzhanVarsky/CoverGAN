I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
One of my exes came to break me off, yeah
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I'm up, can't sleep, can't think because
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
Remember when I said nothing phase me (Phase me)
Well, that was 'til I lost my baby, yeah
But I don't wanna cry
Cut off my bitches, won't return no calls, yeah
I feel like I can die
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Oh
If I woulda listened, we would still be on, yeah
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
You left the pain, you took my soul, damn
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
Maybe if it was all over, I can have you in another life
I'm stuck, fucked-up, fuck love
Got my finger on the trigger, man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I swear you got me fuckin' love-crazy (Crazy)
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
(Reminds me of you)
My heart is broke, you left me cold
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
Whole time you were on my mind, baby (Baby)
I mean, yeah, I fucked, but I ain't nut at all, no
