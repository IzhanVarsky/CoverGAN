Down with the vibes and you know I got you
Do whatever we want to, I would
I follow you, follow you, follow you
If the money get low, low, low
It's all on you, follow you, follow you
If you lead, I'ma follow (I'ma follow)
Follow you, follow you, follow you
High in the sky and I feel like I got wings again
Alone for the ride and I'm bumpin' with the beat, yeah
Follow you, follow you, follow you (Oh, tell)
Stay with me 'til tomorrow
Way down, way down
Somewhere we go
Let's turn the lights down, oh-oh
Doing everything close, close, close
Can't keep my eyes off you
Stay around, stay around
Somewhere we could
Give me all that body, I need you close, close
If you lead, I'ma follow
Yeah, there's just one thing I need the most
