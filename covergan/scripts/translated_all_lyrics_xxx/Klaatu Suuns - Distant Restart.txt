I need to know you are not perfect
You lied you tried to change
Did nothing but it still hurts today
Leave everything that I always knew
Don't leave me now it's late
And there's more to say
I've changed
Stay where is less than ideal
Why would we care to idealize
Don't lеave now it's dead
You lied you triеd to change
It's time to say what we feel now
And we can try to fake
And we will stay the same
End what you say doesn't sit right
I just can't stay where you want me to
