All the times, not counted yet
The joke of the day isn't actually a sneeze
We thought everything would be like
An idea alone is enough until dawn
Yesterday the lot, today just the end
Everything forgotten from the music to the tricycle
If so, we only ride the stupid ones
Tipsy from the moment, we let ourselves flow
Forget everything you've ever thought
A touch of spring preserved in wine
