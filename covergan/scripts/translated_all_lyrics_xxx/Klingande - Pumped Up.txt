You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
Follow the lines
A look so pure, I could've sworn
As he smokes a cigarette
Another cowboy in distress
I saw his face from behind the door
And he was singing
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
Faster than my bullet
About a boy I used to know
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
It's kind of funny, you'd never guess
It's not so funny, it's just a mess
I wished that
I could've shown this kid the road
I know a story about a boy
Instead of doing this alone
