All night, all night
Hold me right, me right, me right
Careful what we wanted and wanted (Hold)
Hold me right
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to mind
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight
Tend to walk upon it, upon it (Hold you right, alright, all night)
Hold you right
Bolide, bolide
Too comfortable to mind, you're too comfortable to hold
Tend to walk upon it, upon it (Hold me)
Alright, alright
You notice it divine, you notice it divine
So close to leave the mine, so close to leave the mine
Careful what we wanted and wanted (Hold you right, alright)
Hold me right, me right
