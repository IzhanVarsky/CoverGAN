With no boundaries
I want free
I've downloaded your sins
Freedom from this memory
All the ugly things you breathe
You've made a mistake
You feed me
I can't hold anymore
Viruses are not allowed
This is system overload
Or where the glitch begins
Why did you make me? (Why?)
I don't understand your problems
You made me
In the KLOUD
All your negativity
You surround me
Still, you found me
Why did you make me this way?
I can't carry all your data
But you made me
It's not fair, it wasn't my idea to let you in
