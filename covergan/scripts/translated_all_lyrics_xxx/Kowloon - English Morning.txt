That makes sense at all
I couldn’t save anything
Is there anything but love
Rearranging to another man
Is there anything above
The only thing
Against the wall
My madman’s raving his
And when your back’s
The engine’s stalling
Bridge
Well, endless screaming’s
This stifled burning
This wingless yearning
This English yearning
The past is calling
This English morning
For another place
Is there a pattern to understand
I’m always changing
Is there a lantern to hold in hand
This English dawning
That I’m up against
This ceaseless scheming
Yet I’m on the fence
And when your backs against the wall
At my brand new man
Written on my face
Stark mad wailings
This constant burning
Outro
But do I take a stand
No
This breathless screaming
These shifting feelings
Chorus
Verse
This hingeless reeling
Is there a ladder to climb above
