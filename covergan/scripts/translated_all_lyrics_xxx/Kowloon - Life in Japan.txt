And does it even matter
I saw you there in the crush
Drifting though a town I know
Thinking “the world I come from
And just starеd
Across the bay
Throwing up again
Its what we wanted to be
Arithmetic has gone backwards
Life in japan
And recognize nothing at all
Ain’t what I thought it would be
Thinking this could be nothing or
I pour my sake
Ain't what I thought it would be
All that I know
And your eyes are sparkling
In the end
Down the drain
I feel my heart
Can't stand the thought of
Can we shake it
Pound like the rain
This could be something”
Is behind us
The faces in the seats
Like the days
Through crowds in Thatcher Squarе
Your smile’s got the
The perfect bend
First call to prayer
Or pretend
Behind the latest lens
Life in Japan
Can we make it
Steetlights speed by
I marched to work
Nothing adds up at all
Train car is lurching
Speakers blared out
Is your heart beating
This could be something
This could be
Is lost beneath the waves”
Don’t ever change
Thinking “this could nothing or
I’m home
