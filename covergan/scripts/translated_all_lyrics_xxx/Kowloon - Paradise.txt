Round and round
This could be Paradise
I'm often scared that you'll be gone
The pages keep on turning themselves
To be found
Right from the start
When it's found
I'm often wrong
When you can see
But if the earth is pulled apart
Even life underground
I'm still yours for good
If I was scared when you called to me
And round and round and
This life ain't never ending
Yes this could be Paradise
And nothing turns in on itself
We've a right to some happiness
There's so much life in the ocean
There was darkness in the sky and in my heart
It's just a moment
I'm not strong like I used to be
I'm not anything that's good
Paradise
The darkness turns to nothing
Living life without sound
Imagine life without music
The daylight turns to darkness
That I'm not what I claim to be
