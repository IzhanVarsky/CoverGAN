I can't see myself in the same place
There is more thing 'than just staying'
What names be I (I)
What names am I, 'it's fine, yeh
That leaves you still and celebrates you
Ok, you, you, you want' (Want')
Baby, no one new like this e' that e' (Eh-eh)
Always on a gray day, you just say Kri'
You go out with all your friends and say (Yeh)
And I ask for the Uber Eat', I always pay the fee
And next to me are those I want by my side
But fight 'and you're not' happy'
You think how much I think and if I think of you
Wait' for others to call me
Spend 'because there's a guy', amen
call a referee
And I already understood (I already understood)
A man who understands how you are '(Ere')
When you want to talk, we don't know how to talk
You like it at home, the comfort, you don't cook
What names amaze you and fuck you well, na' (Good)
And, when you're happy, it makes you unhappy
I want and I don't want to be
Like I was, but sometimes I want you to be recorded
I pull my hair, because that's how it is
Tell me if you're like this, tell me if you're for me
I hit you in a Toyota, in the Kennedy
You're telling me thatâ€”
'Cause she lies 'and she knows it'
At once, because that's how it is
I warned you that I'm complicated
Money in the 'pocket' of the position
And smoke and smoke and fuck
You don't speak, but when you do it to me like this
With women 'that is not worth spending it (Kris Floyd)
What do you have to study for the exam?
You want your man, not a name and that man
you just want to be loved
