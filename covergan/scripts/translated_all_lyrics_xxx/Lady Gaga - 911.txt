I have heard enough of these voices
Holdin' on so tight to this status
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Front I've built around my oasis
Almost like I have no choice
Please patch the line, please patch the line
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Watch life, here I go again
Turnin' up emotional faders
My biggest enemy is me, pop a
My mood's shifting to manic places
Keep myself in beautiful places
Pop a , then pop another one (Ooh)
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
Pop, pop another one (Ooh)
Need a , can you patch the line?
This is biological stasis
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Pop a , then pop another one
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Paradise is in my hands
