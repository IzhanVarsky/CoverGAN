Loner
Being charged of pleasing (yeah, you know me)
Same scenes playing over and over before me
Humoring them big folks thick folks sick folks
Wondering if you ever think about me too
Things can be so penetrating when you’re constantly waiting for something to happen
It’s the freak show king show biz show
Like something significant
When the sun’s on the rise and I’m back on my feet
'Cause all I really see are black holes before me
'Cause all I really see are mad men and palm trees
And I’m bopping to this dream
I see lotus running wild
This house is cold when I need you most
Used to try to be the nice guy
Live the right life
Sometimes when I open my eyes I see
That’s the name homie Oddi gave to me
IG Twitter Facebook Tinder wave at me
Through the coconut trees
Shy guy Shy guy
Wake up in the morning and I think of you
Sometimes when I close my eyes I see
'Cause all I really see are circles before me
tatted on my shoulder
Opportunity yearning
I got lotus by my side
Apocalyptic season (yeah, yeah, you know me)
But I never liked to talk about this before
Fashionably early to the party
A coconut mountain (ay)
Skid wimp soul kid in green
Two years coming now I’m older
A coconut mountain
A coconut mountain (right, alright, alright, yeah, alright, alright)
Checking out the scene
Looking for some loving
