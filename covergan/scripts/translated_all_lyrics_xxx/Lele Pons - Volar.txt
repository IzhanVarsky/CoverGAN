You know that loving me has always been just a game
Lele Pons
Alone, without you I learned to fly
I only know how to suffer
you were a shooting star
Susan Diaz
You say I love you and I don't believe you
that I have learned to fly
You think that I walk in your poison
I learned to fly
I learned to fly (Hey)
I don't walk
Because ours has never been good love
And fly
But forget' that I don't walk
Because I'm better alone
But you forget that I don't walk
That I don't walk, oh
Victor Cardenas
(Lele Pons)
you won't be my addiction
