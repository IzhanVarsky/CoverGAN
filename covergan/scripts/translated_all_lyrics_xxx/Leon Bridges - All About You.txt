It's all about you (Yeah)
It's all about you (Oh-ooh)
I think it's there, baby (Hmm)
I got feelings too (Too)
You do me wrong, baby
That you clearly can't see (Go and talk to 'em for a minute, hmm)
Give you my all
It ain't about me (Ain't about me, baby)
That's really all I'm turnin' like
I got feelings too
Oh woah, oh
Instantly you got me fallin'
I'm in my head
But you like (Girl)
But you like (Oh)
Breakin' down my pride (Oh yeah)
That you clearly can't see (Oh yeah)
That you clearly can't see (Yeah)
I met you in Atlanta
(Ooh, ooh)
I'm just gon' say it
Messin' with my pride
I met her in New Orleans
Then we should let it be
I'm on your vocal like, "Alright right here, alright right here"
Sweet like purple Fanta
I got feelings too (Yeah, yeah)
It ain't about me (Ain't about me)
It's all about you (It's all about you, baby)
But you like
It's all about you
You know I'm a fan of you, baby
That you clearly can't see (No babe)
If the lovin' ain't true
It ain't about me (Oh no)
Hahaha
And you know I'd do a crime for you, baby
It ain't about me (Oh, oh, honey)
Oh yeah
I got feelings too (Oh, oh, ooh)
I think I'm goin', crazy
