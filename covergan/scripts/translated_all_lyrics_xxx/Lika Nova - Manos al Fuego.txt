I know that wanting was a mistake
Do not say sorry
I feel that I lose my fear
Every time I see you
What happened changed everything
there is no fear
But...
And if you burn my heart
In your arms I stay
Because...
It burned inside of me
when it all came crashing down
put my hands on the fire
make me trust again
Time passed and nothing took away
I don't know if someone hurt you
Although the scar remained
it was my decision
It happened to me, I don't believe in love
