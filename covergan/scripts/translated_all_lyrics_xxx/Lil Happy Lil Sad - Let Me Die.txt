Wanna die 'cause I relate
I just need some fucking space
I've been dying all along
I feel colder every day
Wanna die so fucking bad
Now they want me out their way
Nothing helps I'm fucking numb
Baby kill me in your thoughts
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
I've got so much shit to say
You're the best I've ever had
Please don't love me it's a waste
Give me pills and let me vibe
Would they love me If I change?
Can't get over shit I'm done
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Ion really have a place call my home now
Tears are falling down my face
When it's time just let me die
I just make another song
Am I lost? Am I too late?
Cause you always made me sad
Baby take me from this place
Wanna cry I feel insane
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I've been hurting for so long
Get me drunk bitch, get me high
I'll be gone I'll be okay
I get high but can't escape
I'll be gone bitch pass the blunt
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Soon I'm dead I cannot wait
I'm so tired of this life
Wanna die when I look back
I just really can not stay
I walk by I feel them hate
Let me go where I belong
