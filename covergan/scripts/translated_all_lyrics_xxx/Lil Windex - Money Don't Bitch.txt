Bitch, I'm a dog, you know how it goes
It's money I'm chasin', it ain't a hoe (Huh?)
I guess, yeah aight, let's do it
Shorty wanna know my real name
I'm in her dream, like some crystal light
Glock got a dick, shit will do damage
My bitches is bad, they drink Hennessy
She said that it's cool if I go bang her friends
Carry that strap cause my pistol light
If I'm pullin' up, I better cum
Throw on a scope, blow off your nose
And my life a movie, yo' shit is average
I walk in the room and she throw off her clothes
Thirty on my waste, like some Hanes
She want me to wife her, I said to be patient
Bitch, I do magic, do this like a pro
Bitch on my arm, like my veins
Man, I got dogs, got pitbull, though
Forest Gump better run-run-run
Cause guess what? (Hmm) Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though
I mean, you good, but you ain't amazin' ($teve!)
She's suckin' my dick every time that I step in the room
Don't fuck with no opps, you're rich from the street
Girl on my cat like my jeans
Ice me out, nigga, in some carrots
Bitch, I'm the boss, you answer to me
Bad bitch, little bad bitch fucked it up like a savage
Money don't bitch, but a bitch do, though
Married to the game, like a horse with a carriage
She must want that iPhone then, hmm
Ran off with the packs, spent that on a coat
I'm throwin' it back when I'm on that D
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Ayy, ayy, yeah
Fill 'em with lead, I'm a pencil, bro
I slide on that dick like I ride on the bat
Yeah, brr
As long as she's drivin' the Mercedes Benz
Your friend didn't fuck, but your main bitch might
Shoutout to my niggas, I'm givin' them hope
See the red dot? It's a Christmas light
Bitch do, though
I'm loadin' a clip, watch what you see
Bank account ballin' like a Maverick, ha (Mariahlynn)
ran through, I'ma kick that door
She in love with my dick, she said it's her favorite
I'll think about it, yeah
"But what you addicted to?" Buying new pateks
Versace the sheets, it's to go with the robe
Woah, woah, gettin' the blankets
Cause she know how I switch lanes
I mean, you good, but you ain't amazin'
It's money I'm chasin', it ain't a hoe
Fucks, no, I don't give none
I got a bad habit, I am an addict
I might be poppin', but I got the dope
Now she's catchin' Z's cause I rocked her to sleep
Cause I'm goin' dumb-dumb-dumb
