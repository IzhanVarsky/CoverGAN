I don't have cold feet but it’s hard to read you, babe
Oh, I love you whole, you're like gold to me
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap (The sweeter the love)
Was it too rude to just allude?
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap
Are we turning left? And are we feeling right?
We drive down the wrong street on the right day
You wanna roll a spliff but it's the middle of the day
My love’s dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
Picture us nude on Sunday afternoons
Scrabble in my room (Hahaha!)
I love you whole, you’re like gold to me
My love's dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap (The cheaper the love)
I love you whole, you're like gold to me
Can we take the next step? Too many red lights
My love is dirt cheap, and you have me sold
My love, my love, my love is dirt cheap
And is there a time limit on how long I get to keep ya?
With you, I feel the difference when you are away
Is it too rude? Just picture us nude
Happy with a view (Hehe-oh!)
Oh, I know I'm a beast, but you're the perfect creature
My love, my love, my love is dirt (The sweeter the love)
My love’s dirt cheap, my love is dirt cheap
