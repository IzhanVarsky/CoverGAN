It’s gonna be another weird month I guess
Drivin' out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Stuck in myself with all the doors locked
I think I'll dye my hair and I'll move to Alaska
(Na-na-na-na-na)
Well life's a game, yeah I need the cheat codes
Sorry I had to move to Alaska (Woo!)
Just me, myself, and my stupid ego
Eating ice cream in my bed
My fortune told me I’m on the wrong road
Look at my life like a bad before-shot
And I hate the snow, but
I'm the world's most pointless superhero
I want someone to give a shit
Tell all of my friends (Tell all of my friends) I'm asleep if they ask ya '(I'm real)
Sorry I had to move to Alaska
According to my horoscope
Yeah maybe I just don’t know what I've got
Yeah I could bring the vibe down from ten to zero
I guess the problem is that I don’t even give a shit
"Dude, don’t take it personal"
Driving out of town, maybe wave if I pass ya'
Tell all of my friends I'm asleep if they ask ya'
Yelling at the the loser in the mirror sayin'
When I just want to go
Grab all of my money, guitar, and a jacket
At some Chinese restaurant in San Francisco
Last couple of months kinda been a disaster
