But the thought of us can make the time go by
I guess I'll be here 'til July
We still know what truly matters
Yeah, the thought of us can make the time go by
Mm-mm-mm-mm
I find it hard to have no answers
We could walk, but in a garden
The days are driftin' slowly by
We could talk while at the market
Takin' moments of our days to be alone
While we don't have all the answers
Keepin' hope alive despite the darkest storm
