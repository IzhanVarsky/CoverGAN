The things
Thinking back I guess we don't have history
Got everyone looking as you walk away
Yeah let's think about it, wish about it drink upon it, link upon it babe. We can talk about it, love around can find it eh. When we with an answer jumping on to your confession got me a rushing, crushing, hushing, blushing, , your touch
I can't shut it off
When will you finally get the clue
Pull off on a day
Of all that you do
I'm begging please
You're such a mystery
As you walk away
Oh
RAP
Had you in my grasp but you're too slippery
What do i do?
Your style
There's something about you
Can you even try to see?
And when I wake up
VERSE
Through and through
I can't get enough
You are so lovely
Got everyone looking
That you effortlessly pull off on a day
And in my head I love
CHORUS
And when I try to stop
OUTRO
BRIDGE
And I can't lie I only tell the truth
That you effortlessly
There's nothing that I'd change about you
You are you lovely
