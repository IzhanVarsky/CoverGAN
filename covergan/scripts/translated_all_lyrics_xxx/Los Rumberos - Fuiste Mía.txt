I didn't know how to be yours (yours)
Yes it was what I asked for
With your usual whims
Always
dancing without you
You were mine, only mine
It hasn't even been a month since I've been without you...
I don't even know how to blame you
I wanted to have you away to breathe
if it was me who left
If it was what I asked for (what for?)
Hey, sweetheart, who understands you?
And when you have it you lose it
And today I stay, pretty girl...
You were mine, you were mine
you want what you don't have
And today my eyes are cloudy
But it's fatal for me, damn freedom
Your lips taste of the sea
And, hey, sweetheart, who understands you?
And when you were mine (mine)
I will also be the one to make you mine again
Why does it hurt like this?
It hasn't even been a month since I'm without you
And I can't forget
please don't tempt me
