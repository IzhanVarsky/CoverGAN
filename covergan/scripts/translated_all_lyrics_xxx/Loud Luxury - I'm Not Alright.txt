Headed down that road and you don't gotta go down solo
And you don't remember all of your mistakes
You're not alright, I’m not alright
When I'm high in the shade and I’m feelin' a way
I like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
You like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
You're my XO
You're not alright, I'm not alright
XO
When it's all so, uh
We don't need to believe everything they think
You’re not alright, I'm not alright
Gotta fight for the love
No, don't let me go
Baby, hello
And I don’t remember all of my mistakes
I'm imperfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
So don't let me go
You say you’re sorry, but don’t know what you're sorry for, no
And I don't remember all of my mistakes
And when our hearts aren't broke, they're out of place
Got no patience, conversation drivin' you up the wall
And every high got low with no one to blame
What a rush and I don't want to let go
And when our hearts aren't broken, they're out of place
Baby, let's roll
I just wanted to see if your plans ever change
You say you're sorry, but don't know what you're sorry for, no
No point in keeping the score
You and I don't belong in a place like this
I've been perfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
Let's roll
