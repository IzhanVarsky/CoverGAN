I pass the toothless words of the regiment
My throat is a fickford cord
And of course I will marry them.
Who shakes - he can walk
If you, fate, offend me -
And the good - "beauty"
He is faster than you and angrier
I fell a thousand times
I'm a living person
I...
They haven't been around for a long time!
And I got into a fight!
I do not succumb to training
Traces of departed heroes
I stared the Universe between the eyes yesterday
Our time does not tolerate snot
Look, old man, at any puppy
I don't like too much
Who is a coward - get out of the cart
Which is torn from the onslaught of the spheres
But the slave of his nakedness
The night fell into a ditch
I love the beautiful life
And if I donâ€™t cut it with my mind -
And our great dirt
The bus has left
To those who died at dawn
Death carried flowers
Closed the time
A hundred - cursed, a hundred - glorified
I call the bad - "shit"
I am a shepherd, I am a red wolf
Unpack with my soul
They haven't been around for a long time.
I (I) - electric chair
I'm up again now
Raising your earthly prestige
I'll just kill you!
Old women pay martial
I'm all twisted nerve
The dog was warming at the feet
I am a dog god
The ones that I unrolled
I am the poet of the setting day
Blurred spring surf
All lights burned out
Don't sit too long
To hell with tears, longing from them
