I wish I took a photograph
And if you ask me then I say, "It's the best it ever was"
Met you by the ocean, near the stand we got our alcohol
But do memories ever die?
The summer days, no lonely nights
Dancing to the radio, listening to our favorite songs
Now every cold December
Walking down the shore, falling asleep to endless evening talks
Yeah, now I know our memories never die
I wrote you letters to remember
I think about the way you dressed
But I know these memories never die
Singing along all the lyrics to "All Summer Long" (Hey!)
Do our memories ever die?
I think about the day you left
Two shots and a beer was just enough to get us drunk (Hey!)
Now I know these memories never die
The time I used to call you mine
No responsibilities, just running wild on empty streets
Young and wild and reckless, we were trying to change the world
