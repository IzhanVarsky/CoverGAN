About how it hurts sometimes
And the leaves are like fires raging
I hope you're there, with bed-made hair
Our final kiss would bring such bliss
And how I never saw you ageing
Will I wake and know right then
And all those names flash before my face
On the last night of my life
Would there be time for a movie too?
In early eve, you'd start to grieve
And you'd throw up prayers
Think I'd rather be surprised
Will I be strong and able?
On the last day of my life
I think I’d start to lose control
And all your doubts and non-beliefs
Now every night when I close my eyes
I hope there's one about true love
I hope it's deep, in autumn time
To keep me from my curse
But I'd hold you close and you'd pray and pray
As it fades to black and the credits roll
Through every street and every park
The way the wind moves in-between
Will I be blue, held up with glue?
And feel just like our first
My final day had just begun?
Whisper everything was gonna be okay
I wonder what I will be like
Like holding hands and noticing
I think I would love the simple things
And in that morning we’d take a walk
I hold your hand so tight
And a body I can cradle
Would shatter there
Did I thank them all in time?
The afternoon would come so soon
