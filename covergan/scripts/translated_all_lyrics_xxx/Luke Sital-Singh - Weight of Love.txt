But I know what it feels like
To feel the weight of love
Oh oh oh, this is how the future starts, oh oh
She knows
Early light across her face
But I refuse to be forgotten like everything I've lost
Run out to the highest place
She lets go
I know
She rose from a rose bed
It's wild and it's blinding
Oh, the weight of love
Looking for a life, and if anything
To hold the weight of love
Oh it might take everything I've got
Sweet fire on the skyline
I let go
So much time but none to waste
With a box full of all her dreams
She longs to find it, but
Just to feel her heartbeat rise above her life below
I know I'm not old yet
Dark clouds in the mind
Just to feel my heartbeat rise above my life below
But I refuse to be forgotten like everything I've lost"
And runs out to the highest place
To know the weight of love
All alone and a little scared
Oh oh oh, we are dust becoming stars, oh oh
She says, "it might take everything I've got
