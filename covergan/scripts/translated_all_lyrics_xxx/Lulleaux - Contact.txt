Honey, all the time
Got me weak in the knees
Feel the heat increase
And my mind's racing
And I need to feel your skin on mine
To make me lose my mind
And the air gets thin
I can kiss you right there
When we make contact
You got me so distracted thinking of you
It's a chain reaction
Nice and slow
I can barely breathe
We can take our time
When you make contact with me
First a look, then a spark from a second
Feel the beat of my heart
When we combine, feel the satisfaction
When we combine feel the satisfaction
When we make contact boy
It's a physical-chemical interaction
Baby, your touch is more than enough
I'll do anything, make you feel alright
We are just two of a kind
Deep inside my soul
Tell me what you want, boy
