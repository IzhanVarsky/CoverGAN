Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Everybody got bills, everybody got bills
Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn
I said my shoes!
Yo momma got bills, yo daddy got bills
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
I got bills I gotta pay
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
And my shoes, my shoes
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
There's a full moon out, and my girl just keep on howlin'
All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'
Woke up and I bumped my head
Euhhh!
All these bills piled up on my desk
Yo uncle got bills
I got
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
They looking like a mountain (Everest)
Yo sister got bills, Yo auntie got bills
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got mouths I gotta feed
Goddamn, oh man, goddamn, oh man
I got bills
Says she gon' leave me if I don't come home with thousand ( thousand?)
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed
(I got bills)
Ain't got no soul
Praying that my card don't get declined
