What she couldn't see was he was in it for the money (Ah-ah-ahh)
What you thought was fake, hun, the money is real"
He said, "Sign right here," and sign she did
Gotta listen well, only matters how you'll sell (Sell, sell)
Money, money
And you know you want it bad
She was only seventeen
Money, ah-ah-ahh
Got the paperwork so she could sign her life away
Got the girl to move to L.A
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse
"I just want to see you flourish, and I know you'll make it far"
Sign on the line, 'cause you're running out of time
Those who have a chance will trust in Producer Man
He knew that she was too young to know what she wanted
All her dreams would come true
Knew his way to get the girl to listen
And it was in his plan to work her 'til he got his pay, ay-ay-ayy
"Sweetie, this was part of the deal
It was too late now, caught herself with no way out (Ah-ah-ahh)
When producer man came offering that
He said, "Come here, sweetie, I can make you a star!"
A deal you'll never lose
I am your only chance
Made her into someone she isn't
And now she's in the hands of good old producer man
