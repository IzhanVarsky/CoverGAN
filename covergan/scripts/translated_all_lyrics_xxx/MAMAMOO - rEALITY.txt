Shabbyness is more fluttering
Don't feel guilty, understand, care, care yeah
hurt
It's really not that simple about you
about me and about others
Yeah, actually, I cursed you for being trash.
What do I do now that I am staggering?
days without you
Posting pretty pictures today with only regrets
I think it suits you better
of course it doesn't mean anything
Words that ruin me become arrows
Even today with only regrets, you forcefully decorate me
I need more understanding
I keep getting sick of loneliness in this reality
It was difficult to put the words that were spilled
don't cry
feel the weight of my heart
I have a lot to work on
Every time I missing you
maybe i'm a loner
Rubbing your red eyes oh oh
Even if you try to hide me
I'm fine
I never knew love, what is this
Like a fool, I am a lonely lonely lonely sun
Let's keep it a secret that we met on a day like this
So I think I will protect my values
