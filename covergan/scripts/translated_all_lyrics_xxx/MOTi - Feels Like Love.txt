Stop the feeling I know never
Spin me 'round and stop the talking
Ain't got time to waste my time
Stop the feeling I know
When you hold me yeah it feels like love
You just kill my vibe
You're the one and I don't wanna
And take these words to somebody else
I'm good on my own, better listen as I go
In my company
No I can't rewind
Staying up all night
I wanna see
Don't take my energy
Put your hands around my
Put your hands around my body
With somebody who's
Imma get real
Better than you, don't try to talk me
You know, you know nothing's better
Someone who like you
