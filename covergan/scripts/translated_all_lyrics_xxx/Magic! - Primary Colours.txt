Creative evolution
Don't want to confuse you
Enough that I choose you
Before I lose you
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Can we count a little one, two, three
To read, yes I feel
You’re moving too fast
So much I can’t take
Can we get back to basics
So far from the past
You’re painting the future
Your violet is silent
To make this thing last
Your beige is a maze
Your teal is unclear
Your fuchsia’s confusion
Please come back
Your canary is scary
Your aqua’s a hard one
Blue, yellow and red
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red
