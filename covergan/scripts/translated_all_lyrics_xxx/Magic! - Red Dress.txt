And it consumes me
When she walks through the door, I say...
And she knows it’s getting late
And I’m staring at the time
But I’ve got one thing on my mind
I said hey you with the red dress on
Knows that I’ve been waiting and I’m starving
She wants to make a night that we’ll remember
Hey you with the red dress on
But I’ve been on my best behavior
I gotta find a way to take it off
As they pour the wine
It’s just you and me, and I say
She’s tried on everything
You with that red dress on
When I see you with your red dress on
You in that red dress
But when we finally get home later
Everything little thing inside her closet
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
She whispers to me
And I said hey you with the red dress on
"Finish up your plate"
It’s hard to concentrate
Not to cause a scene
You
Cause we’ve been working overtime
And ten thousand lifetimes later
Thinking it’s alright, put on whatever
Pacing back and forth
