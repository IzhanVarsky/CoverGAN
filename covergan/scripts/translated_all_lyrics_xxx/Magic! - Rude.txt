I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah (Yeah)
Why you gotta be so rude?
(Marry that girl) No matter what you say
Rude
(Say) Say, why you gotta be so rude?
"Tough luck, my friend, but no still means no!"
Got in my car and raced like a jet all the way to you
Why, why, why, why?
"Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!"
I'm gonna marry her anyway
"Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still no!"
Saturday mornin', jumped outta bed and put on my best suit
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go
Don't you know I'm human too?
Love me or hate me, we will be both standin' at that altar
(Why you gotta be soâ€“)
