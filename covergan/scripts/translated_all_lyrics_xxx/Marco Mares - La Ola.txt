Tell me, if it's hot, why do I want you to keep me warm?
And she melted that conviction
And tell me, that among so many flowers, I would be the one you choose
May you be the wave (May you be the wave, ah)
uh uh uh uh
That when the phone rings (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I always wake up alone, but today
Come a "I love you", a "without you, I'll die" (Ah, ah)
It's been a long time since it's just me
The earth warmed us
uh uh uh uh hey
And I want to prepare the table for two
That, this time, it stays (That, this time, it stays, ah)
I want you to be the wave that never goes away
A romance at sea
I want you to be the wave that never goes away, ah, ah
I feel like something more
that it's only better
Why do I react to the sun wanting your salty mouth?
And now I want to hear violins and love like in the movies
That there are no pains that you do not heal with your mouth of salt
And melted that conviction
Get out of hand, summer has arrived
that alone is better
