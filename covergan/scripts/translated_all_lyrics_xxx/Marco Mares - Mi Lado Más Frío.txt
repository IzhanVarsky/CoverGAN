Nor should we deny how much fun we had
And you approach me when there is no more, there is no turning back
I want to keep you with the things that make me bad
And even if my bed freezes, I know how to love it when it's cold
You will not cheat, nor will you break, I no longer trust
Today no more, I already learned, I already understood
In the drawer well well behind
That next to you, my coldest side I am
I prefer not, my heart has already been rehabilitated
I want to keep you with the things that I knew how to love
If it's for you, my coldest side I give
For time to take the garbage outside
There's nothing better than an explosion when it's with love
I say it was you
Today I will control myself more
Get in my arms or tangled with your feet
and i will do the same
you say it was me
Along with the dignity that one day I lost
I want more, I already learned, I already understood
you know i'm right
Come closer, there may be more
Let time take us and be vaccine and want
I already realized that nobody fits so well
You were the one who kicked me
You'll fool me, you'll break me
I want to try to leave your name there
