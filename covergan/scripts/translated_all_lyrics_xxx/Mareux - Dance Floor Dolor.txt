Saw you in the back
Got me in a mood dancing by myself
"Don't talk to me"
I choose death, not forgiveness
Then I felt my body, separate
My eyes roll to meet my lovers
Sulking on the dance floor
Between the tracks I look at you
I saw it walk itself to the pit
Then a song came on, and the pain was gone
You were with somebody else
Sulking on thе dance floor
I started moving closer
I choosе death, not forgiveness
Had the look in your eyes that said:
To see what was lost
