But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
It's not fair
I don't know why you hide from the one
Wanna believe, wanna believe
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah
Ah
When you know you can cry to the one
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
I know you need, I know you need
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
Ah, ah
Always confide in the one
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
You can be kind to the one that you love
I know you're built to love, but broken down, so just try, yeah
I know you're chokin' on your fears
And close your eyes to the one
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
