But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
And I'm left there with my thoughts
When the evening falls
Every argument, every word we can't take back
And the image of you being with someone else
When we see what we've become
I will go, go, go
Know that means I'll have to leave
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
Well, it's eating me up inside
Then only for a minute
Not the fire that we've begun
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
So I'll go, I'll go
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
'Cause with all that has happened
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
Far away from the wreck we made
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
I want to change my mind
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
I want to see you smile but
I wanna raise your spirits
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
When the morning comes
