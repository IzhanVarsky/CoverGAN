I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
Every single word is perfect as it can be
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
You're saying the words that I want you to say
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
I think I see your face in every place that I go
Every day
And I need you here with me
'Cause I need you here with me
Now I know I'm falling in deep
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
