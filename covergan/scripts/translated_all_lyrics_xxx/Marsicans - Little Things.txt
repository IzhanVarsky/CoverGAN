As it continues to unfurl
And start to define
You know it’s gold, gold, gold
That I crave
It’s getting light again
Or when you find a bank note
From all the bad in the world
But I’d still pay
As I shield my eyes
That make my mood swing
The cost of the feeling
And I’m not looking for simile
That you’ve not worn in a while
How it makes you smile
I’m lost in the bread aisle
But still enough to change my mind
I just need these little things
It’s these little things
Is way beyond my day to day
Just what I need to get by
In frozen with those little things
Ephemeral
Should be over
And I’m not looking for sympathy
As the rain starts to pour
Like how you feel when indoors
And you’re nice and warm
You know it’s cold, cold, cold
Crumpled up in a coat
'Cause the heating’s on
