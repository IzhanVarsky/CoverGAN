A way for us to never a have to quit
Just sign right up and chasing the flashing lights
So listen up and we can start
Someone who follows endlessly
I'll make you money, make your dreams come true
You should wait for it to pile up
Then come on down and follow me
That's just the kinda thing I do
If you feel you can't come unstuck
If you wanna live the high life
And it'll always be sunny at the weekend
A clear path through crowded room
Live happy ever after when the world ends
Take the
Be very quick, don't leave a trace
After a month you'll sail right through
And the at the divings well
When the simply stands high
You'll always be falling when you ring your friends
If you wanna buy a speedboat
Realise you haven't thrown in a line
No sign of wrinkles on your face
I've got a way you can go far
I got a secret, wanna hear it?
I can always find another scape goat
Oh, the ride you had to
Turn to cold, oxidising you
