We never would have known just how it goes we'll never know what might have been
"Control your heart
And I don't want to prove you wrong
It's hard
"Although we'll never ever part
She said to you
But you said to me
You know
"The feelings start to weigh a tonne"
Fall in love!
Falling in
Fall out with her
And start again"
Well in love you're an amateur
Til we throw ourselves in
Well these things happen all the time
Can we just be friends?"
You said to me
Love with her
"There's only one"
Goes to show that we don't know how things will go until they've been
I never want to see you wronged
So we throw ourselves, throw ourselves in
And you think it's her
Love!
