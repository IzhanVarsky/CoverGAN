I've been asking myself questions
To slip right under all your wonder
You peeled the stickers off my Rubik's Cube
Tried preparing interjections
Too good, too good
Because I've started
Sunk my battleship
Stuck in a world where it all seems
You are, are-re-re-re
Well, I'm sure
You'll spend an hour trying to get your fairy lights to turn on
We spend our lives wishing that our love would long live on
It's a shame I'm no wordsmith
But it's worth it
Too good, too good to believe
Like: "Are you worth it?"
I shut my ears and face my fears
Well, you've won
Oh, it's worth it
You got me caught in a dream
Figure where your heart is
All the pieces fit
We're a puzzle in our own way
We gotta work for it, we gotta work for it
