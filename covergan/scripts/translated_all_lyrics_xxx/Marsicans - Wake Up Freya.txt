I've looked around me and I open your eyes
Wake up Freya, ah
Be shaped by the things that you love
Not what you learn or the people you meet or the joy that you bring
In someone else's structure that we're just here to build
Just try your best to rise above
And I can't blame you, I know it's hard to make sense of life
You'll move everyone to tears, you'll find its a whirlwind when you're here
And I'd tell you this again if I could
You'll be living for dreams until they're fulfilled
It's calm round here, a family of pearls surround you
You'll see things aren't perfect and find that your time will fly
Don't worry about things you couldn't care less for
So what would I tell you, if I knew it all?
Told to measure success by digits and other menial things
So wake up Freya, a new little girl
Where do I begin? You'll be confused and cry
To wake up Freya, you're new to this world
