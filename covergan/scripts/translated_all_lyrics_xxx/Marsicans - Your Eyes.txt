And soon they'll all be having babies
If things don't look better in your eyes
Well the years just pass
And everyone's fallen into all these nine-to-fives
Well the years pass by
If things don't look better in your eyes, your eyes
Are running out of time to mess around and play pretend
Notoriously porous, I might get soaked up by the sun
While all my plans are blurred and hazy
They're changing and they're rearranging all parts of their lives
All my friends
And everyone I know is growing up and old so fast
Try soaking up the scenery hoping I'm a sponge
I can't (Seem to) get myself together
I tried to convince myself
Your eyes, your eyes
The paths are chosen, and they're known that they might never end
Does everybody think I'm crazy?
And I'll regret it (All if)
So if I take the plunge
That I am not overwhelmed
And if I do you'll have to save me
Am I the only one who wants to make this feeling last
