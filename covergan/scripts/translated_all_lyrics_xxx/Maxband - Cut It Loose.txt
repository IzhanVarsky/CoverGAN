You string along all your wasted time (Cut it loose)
I heard the way you sighed
Cut it loose
As when you started on your way
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loosе
You string along all your wasted time
Navigate our way through dry terrain
Been a year since we had to get out
There's nowhere left for me to stray
Been a while since we had to come down
Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose
I want to feel fine
You're holding on, but you don't know why
Still an hour left 'til I get out
Waited for the last commuter train
And I want to leave this place
Cut it loose, cut it loosе, cut it loose
I saw you get shy
Still a ways to go 'til I come down
I found a new tell
Until the day I die
Looking up the way to your new place
I'll hear the same thing
I felt my face fall
Looking up the way to your old place
I saw the same signs
A ringing of a different kind
