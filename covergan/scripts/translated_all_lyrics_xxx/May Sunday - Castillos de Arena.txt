the sunlight hides
I'm lost and left in the dark
tell me that everything will be alright
I realized that you are the tide
With the stars I wrote your name
Give me a sign, give me a sign
After building sand castles
And look for figures in the clouds
Anyone who likes to look at the sky
It's starting to get dark
I can't help but want to scream
Hoping that one day you enlighten me
Hoping that one day you answer me
The scars remind me who I am
And then I turn to the sky
Nights go by and I can still feel your warmth
Days go by and I can still remember your smell
