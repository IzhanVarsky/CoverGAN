I will never stop I always go for more
How many times will I have to make the same mistake
'Cause sometimes it's not enough
The speed at which my world turns is increasing and not
To find it
I declare war and I do not intend to lose it
How many times have I wanted to stop time
To tell you that you didn't come back
I'm right where I always wanted to be
I never needed anything from anyone to feel alive
I'm tired of thinking about the words I'm going to use
Keep looking (Keep looking)
This is the flame (this is the flame)
stop looking for more excuses and come
Over and over to understand
This time I understand I was always complete
that takes us to the other side
I'm not going to stop it
