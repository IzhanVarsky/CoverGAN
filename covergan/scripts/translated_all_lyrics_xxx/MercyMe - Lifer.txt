(My heart is beatin')
Would not, would not change a thing, yeah
I'm a lifer for life
(You call me home)
No matter where I go
Even if I could, yeah
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right
You know it don't work that way
You know it don't change a thing
Or running to you
Like choosing when to breathe
Hallelujah
When you call me home, yeah
I'll keep on singin' for you
I'm a lifer
Whatever might come my way
And before I was created
(My lungs are breathin')
It's what I got inside me
As long as my heart is beatin'
I can just walk away
If it's pushing you away, yeah
And my lungs are breathin'
Yeah, that don't define me
(I'm a lifer for life)
You already knew, yeah
No matter the high or low
(Before I was created)
(I'm gonna keep on singin' for you)
'Cause that's what lifers do
And now, ladies and gentlemen
Living inside of me
And as long as my heart is beatin'
What I, what I got inside me
It's hard-wired
Not gonna stop, I'll still be singin' for you
(Woo hoo hoo)
(Right through the moment)
Ain't nothing gonna separate us
No, I'm not gonna stop
'Cause it ain't what happens to me
Even right through the moment
I would not change a thing, yeah
(Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's right)
It ain't like
You still love me the same, yeah
I know you're gonna be with me
I'll still be singin' for you
I just can't seem to shake it
