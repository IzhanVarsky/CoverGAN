Hey world, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue
The dog is always barking at the mailman
How long has it been? shall we get into it again?
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
Excuse our disgrace, we've had no time to paint the place
I won't waste your time with my revelation
Out of the laundry bin, I found my innocence again
My dear, come again, your voice is fading out and in
How 'bout maybe, it's all been in my head
Hello my friend, I see you're back again
