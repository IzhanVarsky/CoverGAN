Meanwhile, I'm falling down, my heart is getting colder
Well, here we are. This is Sunday morning, October , , and this is Versagio and Lira. Versagio who I talked to last night wanted to see Michael, so there he is. Let's see if we can get him—Michael, look up here! Where you goin', Michael? Yeah, okay. Anyway, he is a real good kid.
Everything is how it’s supposed to be
My heroes all died young, they hung themselves with fame
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be (Hey)
And maybe that's how it’s supposed to be
Woah-woah
I say, "Hopefully"
It’s so cold in the D
She asked me if I think I'll ever see her again
I got a tattoo, it's a joke I keep a secret
I need everyone to notice me
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
L.A. will be out at open sea
The day my daddy died, I was down the street
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be (Ahh)
And these lunatics, molded me
I think I'll buy a gun and blame it on my hometown
I think this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
But maybe that's the way it's supposed to be
But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be
Yeah, everything is how it's supposed to be
We messed it all up, now the world is getting warmer
Everything is how it's supposed to be
I hurt everyone close to me
I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I lost my only friend; people don't grow on trees
Maybe that's how it’s supposed to be
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
