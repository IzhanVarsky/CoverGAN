She would know exactly what to say
Everyone just wants to feel good
I wish Tracy Chapman was my friend
Lit a match and saged my house down
At some point, I will be okay
So I got high when I met you
Beginnings always hide themselves in ends
It didn't make a difference
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
I feel pain, I don't want to
To help fill up the minutes
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on
To hear some things I wanted to hear
I know I got to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
I got high when I met you
Everyone just wants to disappear
Call up girls that live in my hometown
But I have to, yeah, I have to
Went to see some shaman in Malay
I got high to forget you
