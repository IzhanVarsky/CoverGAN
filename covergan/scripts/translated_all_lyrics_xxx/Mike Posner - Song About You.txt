And these memories of us, it's brutal
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Try to be productive at work, I just can't
And your side of the bed still smells like you though
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back
All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans
Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Ayy, ayy)
I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
But you show up in everything that I do (Do)
Now it's a cold war, who will call first?
I think I miss somethin' I never had
I don't wanna write no song about you
I don't wanna write no song about you (You)
Everything that makes me feel confined
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
Sometimes I hate sunshine
I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I miss you a lot, but I ain't comin' back
You know, you know exactly how I feel
Yeah, yeah
Put all your stuff in a box in my room (Room)
