I traded my trimmings
You know the way it gets
Think you got it made
Looking for white robes but the prophet won’t be found
For a white cotton robe
I’m coming down the mountain
I gave up my grudges and paid back all my loans
The yoke of this harlequin world will break you to pieces someday
And you’ll go walking through the rhododendron flowers
Got me a fishing pole and it’s been ten years now
So I packed up my suitcase
I’m coming down the mountain again
I threw away my phone
I told you I loved you, I just had to leave you alone
Get the word to all my good-time friends
The fishing was fine but fishing comes to an end
Isn’t it lovely above the madding crowd?
Coming down the mountain again
Then I went walking through the rhododendron flowers
Let’s go walking through the rhododendron flowers
I was up to my elbows
But I’m coming down the mountain again
I was looking for exits and I had far too many friends
You fools in your cities
