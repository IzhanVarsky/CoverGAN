You explained it all to me today then ran away
My mind
It's the only way
It's like sunshine and I feel fine
It's alright with me I'm fine it's okay
Come this way before you find what is left
You want it all the time
And you say
Then you run away
The records on and you say
I need you on the phone all alone
The records on
You're all I need
(I can't believe)
I can't believe
Then you ran away
You forgot the thing that matters to me most
