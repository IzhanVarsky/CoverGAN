We're fighting off a constant fear
'Cause everything's in black and white
I can't really just explain it
I can't, I can't really...
Except for mine
It's hard
It's like I'm floating in a blacked out sky
(Here it comes again)
I should let someone know
Uh, let me try
'Cause everybody's world's in color
You'll be fine, I say it again
What this pain feels like
Maybe when I'm better
I would rather disappear
'Cause even as we're sitting here
It's like I'm colorblind (It's like I'm colorblind)
That something doesn't feel right (Feel right)
So I'll explain the best I can
It's... I don't know, it's...
Slow down
I know you wanna understand
It sucks
Than face the world outside
I'm okay, well, maybe not
So I breathe, will it ever end?
'Cause that just sounds so dark
I'm floating in a fallen sky
You'll be fine, I say it out loud
And I can't say I'm numb inside
'Cause even as I'm sitting here
So I breathe, am I gonna drown?
But no one sees that part
You think you're okay, but then you're not
No, it's...
