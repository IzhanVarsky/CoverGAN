Everything is upside down
Every single word that is uttered from a tower
And in my experience, yeah, the timing's right
If the cards are really stacked, if they're coming from the dealer
Oh, yes it is (Yeah)
Everything is upside down (Everything is upside down)
Everything is upside down (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Yeah, cut it up, cut it up, it's Friday night
In the bars, in the gutters, in the ears of your lover
Yeah, let's cut it up, cut it up, it ain't my fault
(Everything is upside down, oh)
Every single night I watch the evening news and wonder
It's a love song, man, come breathe it in
Everything is upside down (Oh, yes it is)
If the drinks are truly free, yeah, the odds are in my favor
Someone better go, go, go get the Meyer
On the roofs of Manhattan to the bombs of the summer
Yeah, let's run it up, run it up, it ain't my tab
It's a love song, girl, come turn it up
In the words of a sinner, in the thoughts of your father
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah)
Everything is upside down (Oh, oh, yeah) (Yeah)
Oh, yes it is
And in my experience, yeah, the traffic's light
Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, run it up, run it up, it's Monday night
(Everything is upside down) Yeah
