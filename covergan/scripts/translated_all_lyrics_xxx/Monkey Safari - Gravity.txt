Something's different now
And I drown
Magnetic fields between you and me
This feels like collision course
The moments we hesitate
For the moments we tried
This weight feels less heavy
For the moments we save
When I'm with you, zero g
What am I to say
Hold on
To try
A tender and violent force
A pull of gravity
Pull me in your gravity
I wonâ€™t drown when you pull me into you
I can't drown
Lose my weight
To fight
When there's no gravity
For the moments we fight
My heart grows heavy
Pulling me towards you
What am I to do
You
To save
Cut me loose
Float in endorphines
