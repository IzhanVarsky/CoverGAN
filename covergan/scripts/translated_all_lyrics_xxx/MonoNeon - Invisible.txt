And you try to bе strong
And you ain't got nothing to prove
Put a smile on your sad face
But everything bringing you down
Likе you're a mistake
And you can't take no more
And no one's gonna judge
Don't you wish you were invisible ? (Don't you wish you were
And you feel so strange
And no one's gonna judge you
When you walk at the door
Every morning feels like yesterday
Don't you wish you were invisible ?
Invisible ?)
I been screaming in my loneliness
Trying to find love and happiness
You can be whoever you want
Everything bringing you down
Still be here but hidden to the world
And they look at you strange
Like you're a mistake
So you just turn around but sometimes
But then you're on your own
