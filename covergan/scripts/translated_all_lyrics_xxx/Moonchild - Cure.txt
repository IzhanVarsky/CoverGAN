(I just wanna love you, don't be afraid)
We laughed and kissed
For a while and though
Let me show you, baby
And let me change your mind
I can show you that love
You want the love that I've got to give
I know, I've been there before
I can't hesitate, stay a while
Don't be afraid of a good thing
You think your heart needs to hurt for a while longer
It seems that time isn't right, I know
But I won't wait for a love like yours
Live all alone 'till it makes you stronger
(Won't you let me show you?)
I've had my eyes on you
Telling the whole truth about our lives
Learn who you are without her love
'Till the sun took us by surprise
I'm so in love with what you've got to give
Is the cure for heartache
