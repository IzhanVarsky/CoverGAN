I’m gon' get to know it (Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
I’m rising up
It’s a friendly fight (Friendly fight)
Before you can rise
Hands in the air I’m jumping in
Got to, got to, sink into the feeling (Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
I was waiting out the wonder
I’ve spent too much time
I’m rising up (I’m rising up)
Keep it by my side
I’m gonna learn
There
Won’t let the wait take me under
(Get to know it, get to know it)
Get to know it
I’m done runnin ' from it
Ahh, ahh
(Jumping into the deep end)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
Know the truth is right behind me
The answer’s in reflection
(Get to know it, get to know it, baby)
The truth is gonna find me
Oh, the truth is gonna find me
