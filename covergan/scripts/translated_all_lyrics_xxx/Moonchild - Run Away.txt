Drive me insane
Cause i'm too tired to fight it
More than somethin'
I'm not gonna run away, no
I'm not gonna run away
You meant somethin' to me
Still makes me smile
And i'm not gonna hide it
I'm not gonna
Iâ€™m not gonna run away from our love
The little things
Like we never knew, love
Been tryin' to
Learn to love what's left
Dream my heart
It'd be this hard
So ready to move on
I'm not gonna run away, no-no
But not to forgot you baby
Look the other way
Spinning in my head
I'm done, i'm not gonna pretend
I should have known
To let you go
All i've got to say is stuck
Givin' you this space
