Far from the things I used to know
Tying myself down with all I find
Using the truth to let go
I smile cause I know that it's okay
Wild and free
Far from all the worry that defines you
My spirit is with the breeze
To live in truth
But in my mind
The truth is in love
I found the strength to let it show
I've got this love to help me slip away
I found the strength that I found it
Serenity rests in me
There's love where it's right
Still purpose circles like a dancer
Tired but searching for the answers
In love there's a light
