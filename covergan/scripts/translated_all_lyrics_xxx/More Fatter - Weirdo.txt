Still a party if my body's movin' all alone
(x)
(Get with it)
Just thought I would let you know
Don't you get it
(Can't help it)
(Can't hеlp it)
Ohhh ohh ohh
Ohh
Shake it down, baby
I'm not joking
Shake it up
Time for me to quit the masking
Shaking in my bones
(I'm just a weirdo and so are you)
Caught your eyes in the firelight
I go stupid for you
Lemme make it clеar to you
Records broken, jump in motion
I am a weirdo
Right and left
Just be cool, act a fool
Ohhh
Shake it all around
(All alone, all alone, all alone)
They're always asking
Lemme make it clear to you
What to do?
