Scars are tingling
Blocking is a stiff theory
I'll laugh that it's also good
I try to cry that it's painful
Where is the road we were used to walking
If you eat, Yummy
Toys that make noise and magic that blows pain
Illuminating is a dignity
The days when we got used to walking are also eliminated
We will continue to protect the fountain of life and continue to connect
Graduation without being able to learn
The night sky is divided and towards the guide
The flame rises
Broken heart without being able to tell
By the way why
We are suddenly quitting our thoughts
My dream is a peaceful life
Sometimes it â€™s a tantrum
I remember the gentle melody
All treasures for me
Farewell without being able to play
Toward the light where the surface of the water stands
If it shines, the light will eventually disappear
Tara Tara due to lack of stimulation
Harahara due to lack of knowledge
There is no eternity and there is no eternity
It's not hell
We will walk until the day when the fire of life goes out
It's a hassle
Take a hand is a new memory
This is in the fire
It's going to decay while clinging to Yosuga
To the guide
Wrapped in warmth
Balloons will eventually wither or break
Illuminate is darkness
