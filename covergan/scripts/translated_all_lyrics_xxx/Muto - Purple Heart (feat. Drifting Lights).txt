It’s taken it’s toll
How could I be so kind?
In the back of a stranger’s car
I’ve never been so (Oh) tired
In an effort to keep the conversation (Conversation)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart
In an effort to keep the conversation (Ah)
This world keeps unfolding
I was high at the time
Though it sounds like somethin’ I’d say
Woke up, had been asleep for days
I’m maxed out like my credit card
I can’t remember where I left my mind
I’ve never been so tired (Tired, hey)
How could I be so blind? (Oh)
And I surrender my heart
A happily trashed mind, we’re goin’ back to the grind
In an effort to keep the conversation
Though it sounds like somethin’ like I’d say
(I’ve never been so tired)
Find myself in the strangest place (place)
I couldn’t take it back ‘til I break your heart (Ah)
I’ve never been so tired (Tired)
