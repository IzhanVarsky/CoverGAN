Only a touch can save me from death
Just strayed off course, that's why it's empty
While the night is fading - me and you are not alone
Nothing left, just be
We are pressed by the dawn - it's a pity we can't hold it
You and I will not stay - and I, and I you
She flies with me, even though she's not mine
We die at night, I leave the party in the morning
You smile at me, the poison begins to change us
There is no that pulse, and where did the feelings go?
You cuddle, I just can't run
Silly, falling in love in vain - all this is not about me
I feel your whole body, your forms beckon
The night will pass - I'm sad, the chemistry will let go
We are not identified by us, the Earth does not answer
We just merge in the morning, blaze at night
