If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think on this
Freak out
Armenia, city in the sky
Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to lose some time
And everyone is upside-down
Close your eyes and think of this
If you're troubled and you can't relax
The sky is glass, the sea is brown
Just take off and think of this
If you ever want to disappear
