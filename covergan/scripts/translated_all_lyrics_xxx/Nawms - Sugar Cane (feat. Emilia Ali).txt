Oh if love was so sweet and easy
(Chorus)
Then I would turn this car around
What's with all this blood stain?
Because you kinda blew it up
And we could play who's hurting worse
All I think about is you with her
And rip the pages out
Wish I could take back every moment that I
Cause if you're gonna leave me bitter
Lеast I should get sugar
Oh you should bring me candy and go away
Well did you hear about my universe?
You should bring me flowers
If you'rе gonna leave me sour
If you're gonna leave me sour
Ever gave a fuck
You should bring me candy
Cause I still haven't learned how
Verse :
Least I should get sugar
If my gums gon' taste like copper
Least I should get sugar cane
Oh, I wanna find all my old fairytales and
Cause I got nothing else to do now
If I could put my life into a verse
Drive to where we first met
Well I guess it's time I put me first
And punch you in the mouth
And you can never let me down
