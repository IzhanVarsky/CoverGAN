I haven't eaten for two moons
I like to see your photos
And I can't understand
I was always bad
What I don't like is that he comes out
I only do operations
I don't know what your name is
And I don't want more tv
I do very badly in soccer
Why don't you and I add two
They are pure stories, black regrets
Never believe in the way
An imbecile always arrives and turns us into a three
And I see you since yesterday
Running is very bad for me
I need friends
I was always bad at sports
This time I give up
Chorus
They are pure laments black stories
