I wish you could see that we are kings of bliss
Give it to me, realness
She said, "Your money is your medicine"
Always pretending you knew
Looking outside of me
Begging for misery
I see this world is unraveling
Always pretending I knew
Caught up in specialness
We get lost in comparison
Oh, I don't want to see us lose any more time
'Cause I was lost in comparison
Give it to me, stillness
'Cause Marianne is a healer
This moment is a mountain to move
Was already looking at you
So move it inside
Give it to me, wholeness
When everything you were looking for
But everything I was looking for
Give me some forgiveness
Was already looking through
'Cause you got lost in comparison
But she's sick all the time
Yeah, oh
Wake up now, wake up now
I wonder, who could we be
She had pain on the mind
