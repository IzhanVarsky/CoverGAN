I see you get mad with no words to say
Where trouble came and drove
Baby I won't lie
Go tell him that the dream still fits the plan
Surely it's plain to see
And somehow we get mad giving too much away
We get mad with the load and the leverage of each day
The moment you can say
That you saw in a dream
With no more to pay
No more to pay
But trouble drove away
Yes he's welcome at the stand
We get mad waiting
Oh we get mad giving too much away
That I've seen the day
Waiting to get paid
And that's why we're waiting at the table
I'll wait til the end of time for you
That you've seen the day
And I won't mind
I didn't want to say
But we drove away
And if you see old nitrous man
Open your mind
Selling laughter from a can
So if you see, oh nitrous man, selling laughter from a can
Surely there's time for you and me
We get we get mad with no words to say
How you can let me know anyway
You're not alone
When trouble came a drove
And you see me waiting
Tell him that the dream still fits the plan
Until I heard in a dream how I can let you know anyway
