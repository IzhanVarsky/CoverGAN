Death is perfectly safe
Oh my little seed are you afraid
Where will you be?
Sing on, sing on
Is when you can be
Only the truth is the case
Death, death is perfectly safe
For sure
Plunging as a tear into a river of a light divine
With the coming of the shade?
When your life is a song
Rising from the sea with a rain cloud
So long, so long
Because death, death is perfectly safe
Where will I go
Youâ€™re made
When the body is gone
Death for you, like slipping off a tight shoe
To fall once more
Free
