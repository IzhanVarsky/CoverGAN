Without news
Of the other world
Know nothing
And every day
Our world
Common sense
I can't use your language
let's arm
but we are together
Is better
and the only thing
It is that it is the common sense of an arrow
nothing fits anymore
I have been told about it
shrinks
Or it collapses
your language
I have been told
in the ashes
And why don't you answer?
