We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by
Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
Like a bobber on a wet line
Even if it takes all night, al night
Tryna catch a good time (Good time)
Even if it takes all night
Take our time when we talkin', "Hey Y'all"
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
We just tryna catch a good time
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
Tryna catch a good time
Tryna catch a good time (Good time, baby)
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by
Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Sippin' apple pie moonshine, sippin' apple pie moonshine
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
No other plans other than relax
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Good time
Everybody singin' "Dixieland Delight"
Something 'bout a night this clear
Yeah, we try to catch a good time (Good time)
Makes your problems disappear
Good time (Good time)
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Aw, I think I got a bite
