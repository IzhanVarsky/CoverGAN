Pulling out the line, no compass threads the needle through
Drawing out the gap, picking at the scab now
Whеre the light goes somewhere down the corridor
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, mm
Scattering the ashеs, settle our score
Where the light goes somewhere down the corridor
Getting tangled in the ties that bind
My, oh my
Holding your hand out across the great divide
How come I can only love you more after you're gone?
Making it harder while making it good
Muddying the water fucked my mind
Looks like I got my hooks in you, and you got yours, too
Trying not to laugh, show me where the stitches go
Straight up off the path, kicking up a cloud of dust
