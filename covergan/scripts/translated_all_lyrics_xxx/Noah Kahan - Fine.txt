I won't let anyone tell me that I ain't fine
Take your last breath to mend the fall
I'm just a preacher in the graveyard
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive
This is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
But I sever ties with all my anger
I'm just a fish out in the sea
I'll be just fine
I miss the permanence of failure
I miss the honesty of pain
(I'll be just fine)
And this is for all those dreams I believed in
I might be jaded and delusional
So I guess it's just the world we'll have to blame
But at least I found a home inside my head
I won't let anyone so wrong tell me what's right
This is the wild wild world that we're, we living in
Point your fingers like a gun
I'm just a sailor swimming backwards
'Cause this is for all those lies I believed in
I ain't no different from the rest
Telling everyone but God to follow me
This is the wild wild world that we live in
This is the last damn thing that I hold close to me
I'm just a liar who got lucky
Ain't it sweet to be someone
