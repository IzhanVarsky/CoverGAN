So save me the trouble
Oh no, you don't have to call (I don't have to call)
But you cut me off
You're not in my head, you're under my skin
Yes, I die just a little every time
You're out every weekend now
Don't leave me alone with all my thoughts
Honey, you don't have to lie
Home alone again, I'm wonderin'
Yes, I die just a little
I tried to understand what's in your plans
Burned the bridge and now you're leading me on
That you're busy or too tired
I don't know why I care so much
Takin' all your new friends out
I don't want to suffer, move on
Come on
And what you want
It hurts my pride just a little
Now you won't admit it
Honey, you don't have to lie (I don't have to lie)
We could always talk
I remember when, when you used to say
Move on
'Cause the photos say it all
'Cause the photos say it all (Say, say, ooh)
That you're busy or too tired (I'm so tired)
Oh no, you don't have to call
Even if all we had was lost
And in my blood
'Cause you just keep me hanging on
I see you're letting your hair down
