Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
So I have grown to tell myself a lie
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
Oh, she is sleep when I need rest
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh, for you, I would never sink again
Oh, she hates to say goodbye
Oh, she's the shiver up my neck
Oh, she's the sunset in the west
Oh, she promises to write
High hopes don't last me very long
But I'll sink
And I'll sink
Time slows to let me talk alone
And though the ship can be saved yet
Oh no, yeah, summer comes and goes
Oh, she's the blood rush to my head
When she goes, she stops to look behind
Oh, she's the path in which I tread
So she only says goodnight
And oh, I would never sink again
Winding roads, they never seem to stop
I know it's harder if she tries
