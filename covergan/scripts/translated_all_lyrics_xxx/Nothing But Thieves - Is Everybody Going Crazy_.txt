And leave our afflictions behind
Losing our cool so slowly
It just can't be me only
The sky is crashing down
I saw you down The Neighbourhood
It would feel so good to steal some time
The sky is coming down
'Cause I know it well
You ever thought we're not ourselves?
Can't get through to you lately
Yeah, everybody's going crazy
It's getting more than I can take
I just wanna go blur the line
It would feel so good to make you mine
Spiritual hangover that I can't shake
And in this restless, disfigured place
And I understood
The day doesn't set, the world just spins
I'm ready now to have a change of skin
And in this wounded, sinister place
But heaven's a mindset away
Is anyone else feeling lonely?
We've only got each other
We're so hopelessly faded
I know it's strange
When heaven's a mindset away
