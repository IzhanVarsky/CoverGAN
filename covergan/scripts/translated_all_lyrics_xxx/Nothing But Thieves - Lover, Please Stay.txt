Lover, I know you're weary
And I can see you, I can feel you
So take from me what you want, what you need
Slipping through my hands
If I am tonight, I'll always be
And I don't wanna be alone
Lover, come to the kitchen floor
My lover, please stay with me
Tiles are cold, so am I
But lover, please stay with me, oh
Take from me whatever you want, whatever you need
Eyes are tired from the night
Lover, I feel your sorrow pouring out of your skin
Oh and I can taste you, I can taste you
