I'm tall with her, sweet as Mai Tai, she says, "Honey, take off Balmain."
And tell me, would you be there, darling, when I drink that, would you be there when I drink the table
Awake until three, or at least two, always her arms around my neck
All night with her, I know I don't sleep
She doesn't get tired of me, as if I'm not there, she's still courting
The body is as soft as cotton, as white as pure, I shine in my eyes
Her gaze is like from the top floor, she is spinning, manta, I am hers from the start
How many per mille of every moron did you refuse, darling, last night?
The smell of smoke in your hair, where were you last night, how much did you drink?
Here I come baby, baby, baby, here I come baby
Is this Popov?
There is a mark on my neck where she squeezed me
In my gin lime, he works as if to pull the line himself
Half the world killed me, then when she kissed my lips with hers
So where are you?
Here I come baby-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
