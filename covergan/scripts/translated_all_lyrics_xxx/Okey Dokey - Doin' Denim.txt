Playin' songs for women
Look, there's somethin’ up ahead
El General Jackson is runnin' on empty
Generally I'm a player
Wanderin' way back to '
Don't know what I'm doin
Wander through the night
Wander, wander
They still recognize me at the bar somehow
El General Jackson, is runnin' on empty
Ready to keep on the fantasy phone
We lost all our leather
It's lookin' like it’s years from now
Wanderin' way back to ‘
Now we’re lookin’ country
Dreams, I haven't had one since
Oh, I know I fit in with them
Wander through the day
Don’t know what I'm doin'
Now we're lookin country
So I drink until the sun don’t rise
But I know I fit in with them
Oh I know I fit in with them
Playin songs for women
Now we're lookin' country
At the watering hole
Now we're doin' denim
Now we're doin denim
Sleep is for the weak
I'm lookin' for a bed right now
Don't know what I'm doin'
