I'm in my Wednesday suit
How'd we get so far?
Call me when you can
Counting down the days
You said the air was crystal clеar
Oh, oh
Don't think about the future
Only advertisers know me
Do you understand
What am I waking for?
I'm just so sick of this commute
That I'm brave enough to follow?
Call you when I land
I get attached to my surroundings
Tryna make a better mistake
Tryna make a better escape
Like they know everythin' about me
Are they always speakin' to me?
Or maybe I'm just falling apart
Am I waiting for a sign
Can I just fail enough to bail out?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm in Belvеdere
We're gonna figure it out
Don't think about the distance
Not everything is missin'?
'Cause failure is a feature
Maybe lend a hand
Maybe I'm just fallin' away
