Is the call not enough?
Everything was running smooth
Los feliz
I can't keep up
'Cause everyone is feeling it
I was lost
But I don't believe
Come with mะต
Pacing in my work shoes
Everything was lit brilliantly
Take your old
All is well
In its place
In my place
Something in my memory
Found a way
A passive attack
Just terrible luck
Say goodnight
Maybe it's me
Say goodbye
In the deep
Close your eyes
Can't you see
Say a prayer
The champagne was off
Rosary
Fall asleep
Is holding me back
Everything is sat perfectly
