I wanna be free
Not alone but enough
Burning my skin, wish I could hear
All I can hear is my daughter cry
You know I'll never miss thе smell
Carelessly me
Of your obvious tell
Just need you at home
Brutally honest but always harsh
Took it back in time
The mother in your mind
Where were you at?
Are you saving a life
You had every right
It's summertime low
Wish I could see autumn
The weight of the sun is making me thin
To have a summertime low
Weight of the world is breaking my back
The way I've been falling
Thе stars do not care
Take it in your stride
It's hard to be open
I wanna be well but don't wanna try
I'm missing your touch
Or your shit magic spells
Everything is unknown
With everything golden
All of the ways you sing in the dark
The tides are comin' in slow
Burning my skin
