Well either way we're gonna be just fine
Two steps forward, ten steps back
(Everything's gonna be alright)
You know some people never change their minds
Alright, alright
You see, I'm still here, let me adjust my crown
I can hear you loud and clear
Even when you try to bring me down
It gonna be alright, alright
Killing us dead, Black lives don't matter
Things will be alright
It feels like you don't want me here
It will be alright, alright
