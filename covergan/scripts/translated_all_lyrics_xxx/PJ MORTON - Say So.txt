La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"
I don't wanna go but I'll walk out that door, oh, woah
Ooh, mmm, mmm
So I'm trying my best not to overreact
But I need to know right now, no lies, just facts
This is for my peace of mind
Then baby, let me know
So if you love me, just say so, just say so
If you love me, just say so, then just say so
Mmm, mmm
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more
I need to know if this is really real
So if you love me, just say so
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
Oh, oh-woah-oh
Baby, I hope that you understand
And if this love isn't what you want
It's just that I can feel I'm falling deep
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more, oh-woah
Just say, "La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
See, nobody wants to be in love alone
So if you love me, just say so, then just say so
So if you love me, just say so, can you just say so?
I need to know from you right now before I go
And I just don't wanna waste any more time
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
And if you feel the same way that I feel
And I don't wanna fall unless you're falling with me
It's getting hard for me to hold my own
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more (Oh)
