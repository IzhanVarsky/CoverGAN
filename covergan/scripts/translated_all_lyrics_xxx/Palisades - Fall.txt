I came for your body, but I stay for the vibe
Got me so drunk on the thought of your touch
I can feel her body asking me to give her everything
When you're out there, you just wanna have fun
She got me sweatin', don't know what the hell is wrong with me
I wanna fall and never once look back
I wanna make this the start of something
Tell me what you think about me
Wondering if I got what you need
So can you say that you want it all?
Let me try to make you the one, I could be that man, let's go
I've been staring into these sheets
'Cause I know she knows that we can't let it go to waste
Got me paranoid, caught up in the feels
And I don't wanna think that I'm just a crush
So can we fall and never once look back?
(When you're out there, you just wanna have fun)
'Cause baby, I'm not looking for a "ten night stand"
I wanna feel like it's all or nothing now
I wanna know I make you feel like that
We've been up all night for two weeks
I don't even know if this shit is real
But playing with you, baby, just ain't enough
'Cause I don't wanna leave it alone with a "ten night stand"
'Cause I know she knows we've got the finest chemistry
And I don't wanna think that it's you on the run
