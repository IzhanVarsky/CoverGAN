I need it more than ever
Go back under
Slow down, never
It’s overnight
Go back, I want
I will stand, as I've won again
Fall in, be gone
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
Hope that I fall on the track
So bad to hold you back
Overnight
I know now, I know better
It’s all I've said and done
The moment I was wishing
The reason for no more
