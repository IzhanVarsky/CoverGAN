Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Believing through the eyes of sure adoration
When you returned it?
In walks the darkness, I pitch without you
Asks me do I realize what I'd done and who I'd done to
It never leaves me, just visits less often
There's no suspicion, no hesitation
Waiting to retry
And now if only
No music plays and nothing moves without drifting
Into a memory
First saw you the way I see you now, through these eyes
Sink full of dishes and no trouble believing
Witness and know, fracture and hurt
One way of shaking off the thoughts that it sleeps with
Breathing beside me, feeling its warmness
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours
Busy apartment, no room for grieving
I'd never felt it, I'd never heard it
Indeed I do know
I know exactly where I was when I
So few are trials when a life isn't lonely
Phantom affection gives a human performance
I know I loved you, did I even deserve it
Those pristine days I recall so fondly
Without a coffin
It isn't gone and I won't feel its grip soften
Mid-sentence tremors, mind at its weakest
That you are leaving
Shield like a house closing its doors
Ashtray is crowded, bottle is empty
