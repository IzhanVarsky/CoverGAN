Someday from one country
The whole universe is magical
Even chance is fate
Since the genuine future
I was looking for meaning
Endless sea of ​​rays
After all, the royal fern was rolled up
I want to live the maximum limit
I was holding my heart
I have to go right away
I can't even solve it on a computer
Play Play Play Regenerate
When I was a person
So I have to go
I'm heading with all my heart
But from the last country
I still remember
{Verse}
Hikari of life that stops
The dream was already cold
I received a letter
Only your memories
Of tears spilling
