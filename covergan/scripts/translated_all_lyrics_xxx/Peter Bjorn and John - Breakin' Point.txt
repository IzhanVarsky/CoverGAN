Now the clock sets the scene
We're running on empty, leave it all in your hands
We've been eagerly awaiting your entr√©e
We're running on empty, I leave it all in your hands
Now show me what you do
In the European late October night
Saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
All I really wish is you'll be doing fine
Got it from whiskey like any loser can
Now show me what to do
What to do? What to say?
Listening to you
Stay inside with your doubts
All the trivialities are out of focus in my mind
You've been hiding in the bosom of my dream
In the quest of what it's worthwhile or just trite
I've been waiting for your kick to set me free
On the couch, hypnotized
It's a small step for humanity, a giant step for me
I'm listening
I'm listening to you
Been running on empty, I leave it all in your hands
I saw it in Jesus, saw it in Superman
