It might be a bumpy ride
I'm out here on my own tonight
Reap the rewards of what we've grown
Time's a thief, a hardened act to defeat
Keep a close watch on the good thing you found
And we're gonna rein it in
Decades in, you wake up all in a daze
Hey, man, we gonna rein it in
It's a dream, it's a dream
I'm the keeper of the scene
This one's for the team, this one is yours
But we're built to last and run the course
Yet all of the goals so far away
But I don't wanna play this part alone
It's a team, it's a team
Clear out the cobwebs of the mind
Leave all the pettiness behind
We can rise above, unwise and unkind
There's no one coming home tonight
But we're still here by your side
And all gold that glitters but it's mine
