You raise a toast for your setting son
Tell me lies and I will listen
I can't understand what you talking about
When I can't understand what you talking about
Now you're just another boss
Though I rate myself as zero
Cause I can't follow through
How could I sink this low?
No, I can't understand what you talking about
You don't have to shout
I'm drying off in the aftermath
And I can't understand where my patience gone
Tell the truth and I'll be gone
All the anger left my body
Cap in hand, waiting for my saviour
I got a message to you
Tell me why I need permission
Our acquaintance has been so-so
I was on time but you turned up later
What you talking about?
You used to be my hero
Always expecting to end up alone
Shining in your shadow
Five years as your understudy
