All of these voices that are warm inside my bed
Babe I be your potion, when you cry
You give me pressure like the walls inside my head
You keep talking on my ear, dear
When I'm falling out of love
Until you resolve them, get the fuck out my past
Get rid of your fear
Take your tears back, I don't need your problems
I think you should give me faster calling than I'm after
When you find me swimming across your ocean
I won't fight your demons for you
