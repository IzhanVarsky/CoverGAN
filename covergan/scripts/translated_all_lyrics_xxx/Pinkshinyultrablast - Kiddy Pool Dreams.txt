Bind thoughts, oh, there are so few
A touch you touch I still comprehend
At dusk we're driving down to the beach
Over the crowd I notice your smile
Down through the valley and almond grove
Following highways by hours that chide
On the road the burst out of silly jokes
And you reach over for my hand
Let's build our castles and lakes of sand
Humble nourishing my dreams of you
Say what - trying to make this work
Drunk on a liqueur of fennel seeds
The curly washed capes and strips of land
The hazy mountains are up above
The roaring shoreline's aside
We're rolling reckless and playful
Guess I'm wrestling to make up my mind
You know I'm smothered by all these words
Bursting all apple blossoms are swaying
I'll leash my fears beside me
Mumbled in my ear, your love is true
Night brushed these mountains in purple
Lined up into a whimsical cradle
Crumbling fears that nestled inside
Soothe me, come into my dream and stay
Soft spot I'm wading through all these words
The ocean's glimmering surface
I'd rather hang here beside you
