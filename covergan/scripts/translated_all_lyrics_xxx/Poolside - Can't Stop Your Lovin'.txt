Can't stop your loving
I can't stop when you're with me
Why do I always, push away
Don't wanna be sad again
(Never each the finish line)
The things that I, I wanna say?
It feels so real
More than love I've felt before
History, keeps ourselves from moving on
And can you believe me when I say
And never reach the finish line
Don't wanna be lost boys
I can't stop your loving (I can't stop it)
I can't stop, you're playing with me
Oh, can't stop your loving
Why do I always push away
(Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop)
I just can't stop all your loving
And I know now there is love
With you, this feels like the first time
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't stop your loving
Can't stop when you're with me
I will try to keep you satisfied
(Can't stop, I just can't stop all your loving)
