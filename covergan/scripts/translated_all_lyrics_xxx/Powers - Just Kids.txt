'Cause it's you and me
Wants to see your soul undressed
We're just kids
Your body and your mind
The devil on my shoulder
I've got a feeling, feeling, feeling
I've got my hands all over you
Tonight, 'cause it feels like we're just kids
Wind me up and watch me go
You and me
The angel on the other
Doing what we do so what if?
The truth is (tru-u-uth)
Your energy is speaking
It's telling me to go ahead
I'm feeling
You and me, babe
So what if?
Singing, singing, singing
This is what kids do
Wanna get inside your love
Singing, singing
The truth is (uh uh)
Wanna get inside your world
Oh oh, yeah
I wanna get, wanna get, wanna get
Uh, I've got a feeling
And I wanna let you know
