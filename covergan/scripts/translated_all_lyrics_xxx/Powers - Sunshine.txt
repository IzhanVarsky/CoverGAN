Woah it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you
Sunshine
Woah, it's gonna shine, gonna shine on you
Baby its true, oh
Looking for a happy place, little piece of grace
Baby it's true
Rain now, all over you
Following my feet
Going through the motions, yeah
Put it in my pocket, oh
Woah, my my
Baby its true
Good times are gonna come now, look 'round
Watching it unfolding, yeah oh
Good times are gonna come now, all around
Throwing wishes at the street
Tried to get away, but I slipped on my hands
Rain down, all over you
Sun is gonna shine, gonna shine on through
Yeah, I jumped and I flew till I fell where I am
Oh but time, ain't got time to be waiting around
Sunshine is gonna come now
I'm still cutting all my teeth on a faded dream
I was trying to escape into outerspace on a bottle rocket
Swinging on trapeze
You should have seen my face standing at the gates
No one to unlock it, oh yeah
Looking for a moment
I was blowing with the breeze
She too busy paying money and she ain't slowing down
