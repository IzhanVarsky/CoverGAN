Crackin' ice in a soda
So give me that cold fire
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away, oh
Can't let ambition fade
But someone woke me up two stops short
Like a knife in a cut through
'Til the last glass breaks
With no bag, no clue
Everyday, think I seen your face
Can't let the memory fade
Tryna tell myself nothing's changed
I'm running blind
Up on the mantle, those trophy wives
'Cause I'm alright
But they've been creeping back everyday
Everyday, think I seen you
Through streets don't lie
These streets don't lie
Making money, not making time
Like a knife, really cut through
During all those years away, oh
I don't remember which train I caught
Walking home in the pouring rain
No regrets when I walked away
No love, no life
