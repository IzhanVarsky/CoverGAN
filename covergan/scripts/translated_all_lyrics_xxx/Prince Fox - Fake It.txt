'Cause I don't miss you, I just miss having something
But if you turn around and I drink all this down
Too many chances though, I thought that you knew
So close I hear you, I smell your perfume
And I know it's nothing real but for fun I don't need feels
Maybe faking it isn't making it any easier
I know you miss me, you said that you do
But I could watch you fall in love a hundred times and still feel nothing
Easier on me
(Two, three)
Four feet behind me, you're talking to somebody new
Maybe we can fake it one more night?
Fake it
One more night
That I could watch you fall in love a times and still feel nothing
