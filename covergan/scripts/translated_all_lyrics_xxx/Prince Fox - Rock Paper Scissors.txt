You know it's best, so why, why are you bitter? (Bitter)
Say it to my face, don't take my name in vain
I cut you, rock, paper, scissors
No, I'm done with you
You wouldn't be sweet if I dipped you in sugar (In sugar)
I cut you off, I cut you off
You could be Aretha but got no respect
I cut you off
I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off, I cut you off
Rock, paper, scissors
Say it to my face, you know you can't replace me
Just want a chance? No thank you, next
Crying to me you're always alone
But I want you to
But you bringing trouble when you leave the home
See, that's what you do
