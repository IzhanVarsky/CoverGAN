Or how to begin in the end
These mysteries of life
(Yeah)
Anytime, anywhere, and I say babe
I wanna make it wit chu
(Whooo)
The only thing I know for sure
(Again and again and again and again and again)
Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
Is what I wanna do
And I just can't recall what started it all
(Anytime, anywhere)
You wanna know if I know why?
That jus' ain't my thing
I can't say that I do
Just see how far it will bend
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I'd be untrue
Or how one becomes two
Again and again, again and again
I ain't here to break it
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon
Don't understand the evil eye
