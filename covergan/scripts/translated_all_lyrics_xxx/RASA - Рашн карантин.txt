So be it, I won't be angry
I have enough, in kind
Home is better anyway
Brighten up this quarantine
And we are Russian quarantine
Now cleaned up in the house
In the closet and on the balcony
Everyone is calm, in self-isolation
My dance floor is a bed
Hoi, we're not flying anywhere
We will sit, we will sit
Bored new clothes
This small square
Wear a pillow dress
I'll go wash the dishes
Positive is our best vitamin
And walk the dog
Make up even for a photo
Only we are not sad here
See you online
I'll make a video on TikTok
And I'm at home, at home, at home, at home
Everything is on our conscience
Let me go I want to dance
TV shows, games, sleep
And we'll wait until summer
Nothing to visit
Looks like gray hair
To keep the virus from spreading
Let's go to the store right away
Mutim dances even at a distance
