The atmosphere suddenly becomes so serious
Maybe she likes you
she looks at you
There is always a choice
I don't get it, it was so beautiful, not normal anymore, everyone
Did I lose it, or did I leave something somewhere?
tell me where
Your presence disappears
And then we go to our house
you just stay here
Why am I so nervous
But in the same language
That we whine, that we whine
In the rut of so many years
We are growing further apart
It's already late isn't it
Now that the door has closed
How quickly time can break
What are we still doing here
Then I'll go home
Go in, sit down and have a drink then
Soul alone through stubbornness
What we forget when swearing
Do you still want your beer
We continue to grow as far as you can call it
And you her, so each other and you can laugh a little there
My world just gets smaller
All life on the shovel, looking for a dream story
Come on let's go to my house
And I'm looking and I feel bad
So drink your beer
What an idea, what a plan, oh damn man
