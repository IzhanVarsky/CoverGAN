Yeah, I know it makes you tear up
Look, you get so flattered over likes
In the best direction
If you ever seek validation
But ain't nothing set in stone
I'm so introvert
Girl, I can tell
I know it took a good sixty pics
Voicin' bad opinions
Under photos shatter you
I sound upset, I know
Who do you love?
Back and fourth we go insulting each other for what?
In your camera roll
For me
Argue then makeup
Before you decided to upload
I see the light whenever you post
But all you post is positivity in attempt to steer them
Girl, you know how social media goes
Better than my friendS
But feel much darkness from this phone
Please do that for me
I be like "woah, whoa"
I wanna follow everybody that follow me
They hurtin' too
Yeah, it's always been two of us
I know lust is temptin'
Merry go go round in circles
No, we don't need new friеnds
Though you get so upset
I see the light when I'm with you
But the trolls that bestow bad comments
Please be positive
Can't have no one come scrеw this up
Yeah, aye
Girl, ain't nothing set in stone
Your indecisiveness is owed
And still not get the response
This is what humans do for love
Please by positive
Yeah, they matter to you
Please post positivity
I done lost my senses
Just look in the mirror
Because
But sometimes I may seem so vocal
This damn explore page got me scroll, scroll, scroll
We been through it all
But still feel darkness from my phone
Damn, that's so antisocial
This algorithm knows me well
Under one condition
With good hopes you hear them
Yeah, yeah
There's too much negativity on my timeline
