I don't wanna spend another minute waiting
Somehow the golden state has got me feeling blue
But running always makes me feel alone
And you got me saying
My soul is craving for a little change
In the blink of an eye
But I just get so damn insecure about it
I gotta go, I gotta get away
(Ohhh)
Oh baby, mile high
But oh, my baby
So far gone, with nowhere to go
I want you to go with me
I bought us round trip flights to Paris, baby
Things come and go
Waiting around for someone else to make my move
(Ohhhh)
We can fly
But standing here just makes me feel this way
Well, it seems to me my life is passing by
Running around talkin about how I got nothing to prove
I gotta go now, I gotta get away
I need a break from California lately
Cause I wanna go somewhere and only be with you
