Give it to me
It’s a give and take kind of situation
I've got that burnin' like a fire
Put the pedal to the floor, come on let's go
Light me up, light me up when you feel the urge baby
I know exactly what you want from me
You've got that look in your eye
We can always take the long ride home
How do they do it so well
It's like a bomb went off, and I think just maybe
Cause it's a Gunpowder kinda love
We'll rock it out till the sun comes up
Like no one is watching, no one is watching
It's not what you think it is
I love that Gunpowder smell
Believe the words that I say
Light me up, light me up I'm feelin crazy
We've got the pedal to the floor
So pull the trigger, pull the trigger
The way we're blowin' it up, makes me think just maybe
We're racing the daylight
Round two, I find, myself, thinkin' about you
The Gunpowder makes me feel this way
Cause it's a gunpowder kinda love
Let's give it another try
And set it off like there's no tomorrow
We're the only ones here tonight
Let’s fire it off tonight, fire it off tonight
Not a day went by I didn't dream about this night
We're gonna light this fuse
We can count on the red and blue
So let’s light it up
Light the candles and we'll talk it up
It's so much simpler than this
Gunpowder
I've got a sickness that won't go away
For breaking my heart, you know exactly how to make me choose
