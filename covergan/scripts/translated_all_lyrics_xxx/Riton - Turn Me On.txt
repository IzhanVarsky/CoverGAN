'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Living life all wrong
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love
'Cause I need some more of your healing
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
Doctor Love
I can never dim the lights again
(Doctor Love, you know just what I needed)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
But my heart, it was made of stone
And just give me some love
But all that glows ain't always gold
