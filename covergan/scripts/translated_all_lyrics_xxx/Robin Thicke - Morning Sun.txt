You were born a star
The only one, the only one, yeah
You got everything I want
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun
I thought that this love affair
But now you're my midnight moon
In all the right places
You're the only one
Would only last one night
Didn't know you could do
I want rest of my life
My morning sun
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
I wake up holding on to you
Yeah, and I got the feeling
You are the one that calls me papi
Twenty different smiles
Baby, you're the one, hey
Every night, you do something
I wake up smiling next to you
Ooh, yeah, I got the feeling
My morning sun, ooh
My morning sun...
You are the one, so why stop it?
It turns out that this feeling
And my morning sun
You are the one, good and naughty
And twenty more when you're naked
