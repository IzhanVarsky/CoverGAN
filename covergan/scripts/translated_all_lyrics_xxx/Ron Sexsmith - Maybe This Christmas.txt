For reasons we can’t quite recall
And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
Maybe this year love will appear
Maybe this Christmas
Someone we love, someone we've lost
In heavenly peace, grateful at least
Deeper than ever before
Will shine once more, oh
Maybe this Christmas will mean something more
Maybe the star that shone before
Maybe there’ll be an open door
For the love we've been shown in the past, oh
And maybe forgiveness will ask us to call
Maybe this Christmas, maybe this Christmas
