I finally saw it, waiting for me
Never stop wondering, how I could be
Wrapped in a moment
Feels like I'm home, home, home
Home, home, home
It's been too long, long, long
Turning the key
Feels like I'm home, home, how
Nowhere to be
Somewhere to run to
Life in a locket
Laughing wild eyes
Oooooo,oooooo,ooooooo
Feels like I'm home
Breathing a life
Smile like a blanket
