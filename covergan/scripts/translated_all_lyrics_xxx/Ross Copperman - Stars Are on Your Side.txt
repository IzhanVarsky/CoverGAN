If you're ever broken, there's always an open door
Somewhere past tomorrow is better than it seems
So get up off your knees, hope is still alive
And that all is never lost
That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find
Just exhale
'Cause the stars are on your side
Yeah, the stars are on your side
If you're holdin' breath, tired and you're frail
Know you're bound for glory
Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see through the other side
No mater the cost
The life you're livin' dreamed
A beacon towards the shore
Sometimes you need fire to see the other side
