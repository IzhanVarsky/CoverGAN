Watch the storms of life
We should carve a heart
I wanna drink the rain
We should plant a tree
And the leaves fall down
We'll wait for spring
I wanna shelter you
To come back around
That we were here
And when we're just a stone
I wanna stand with you
I wanna be with you
We should make some shade
In a hundred years
Wash the storms of life
Be strong and solid to weather
I wanna bend with you
From a front porch swing
And our roots run deep
I wanna reach for you
And when the wind is cold
I want the world to know
And you can shelter me the same
While our dreams grow wild
I wanna show you that I'll be here
I wanna feel the sun
Yeah when the wind is cold
When the seasons change
Whatever comes
Where the river starts
