You couldn't tell
Left me standing all alone
Yeah, I'm crying, crying
And from this moment on
I love you even more
When you said, "So long"
Yes, now you're gone
Crying over you
I could smile for a while
Than I did before
Can start me crying
As you stopped to say, "Hello"
I'll be crying, crying
And I'll always be
It's hard to understand
That I'd been crying over you
Alone and crying, crying
But it's true, so true
I was alright for a while
Oh, you wished me well
But the touch of your hand
You held my hand so tight
Over you
Crying, crying
But I saw you last night
For you don't love me
I thought that I was over you
But, darling, what can I do?
