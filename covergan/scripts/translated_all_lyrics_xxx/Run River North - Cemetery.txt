But now I'm wishing I could slow the whole world down
When you started sleeping on my couch
Somehow I wish I could slow the whole world down
Was it Tuesday in the summer
But now I'm wishing I could slow thе whole world down
This day started ordinary
Hesitating with commitment
Longer
It's a feeling that we both know too well
Everybody needs a way to hold on
Midnight in the cemetery
And I lost track of the details
Good intentions, empty handed
Just a little bit
Is it crazy if we stay herе all night long?
Sunrise in the cemetery
Of what is and what isn't allowed?
Is it crazy if we stay here all night long?
Out of fear that we may break the spell
Last night started ordinary
