(Every second's getting worse)
Don't leave me hanging on this line
I'm in love with the summer set rays
Every second's getting worse
It's inevitable, it's inevitable
Hummingbird with the high bеams on
I can't explain how much it hurts
There's not a next time, just a flat line
I can't stand to see you falling
Can't take this with me, why?
I'll go until you call just
(I can't explain how much this hurts)
Hummingbird with the high beams on
(I can't stand to see you falling)
(Say you told me so, say you told me so
Can't take this with me, why?)
Someone cut me off one more lane
You're losing morе than what you're worth
I can't explain how much this hurts
Light speed at the crack of dawn
I can't explain how much this...
But I see no faults, I fall, I'm falling, falling
You're losing more than what you're worth
