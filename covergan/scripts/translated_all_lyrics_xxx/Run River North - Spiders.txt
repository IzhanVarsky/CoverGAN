Under the desk of classroom I once slept in
The bubble never blew up
Pieces don't seem to fit
Of what you don't even know
Don't remember where I parked
I can't shake 'em off
Lately I've been stuck like gum
Spinnin' yeses and noes
Spiders up the wall
I can't make sense
Why the silly face
The middle of your web
Chewed all of its flavor and love
When the room's so serious
Up to the ceilin'
It's just the way it is for now
I think I'm goin' too far
The basket was just too far
Feel like I'm losin' my head
And it's never enough
Caught up in the
Just the way it is
Don't leave me in
'Cause no one sees them
No one's happy
