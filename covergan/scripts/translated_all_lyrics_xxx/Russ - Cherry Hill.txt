Maybe I'm a fool
At the top of Cherry Hill
But I'm still swimmin' in your vision and it's temptin' me
I know what you'd do for me
I'm looking for the place
Maybe I'm a fool for you
Where I was falling into you
When we were
The truth in me
We should have been
Feelin' lonely in this room since I was
You know what I'd do for you
That lived inside me
Dressed in sunlight, warmed the cold
What we said
You will see
Thought this bottle was supposed to drown my memory
But next time that I call I'm hopin' that you answer me
