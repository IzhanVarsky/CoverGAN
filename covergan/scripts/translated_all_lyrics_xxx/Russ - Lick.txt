Cause we're about to hit a lick
You gassed cause you ride around bussin' come ups
But pump yo brakes and lift yo tongue up
Pretty face gets her what she wants
Cause Im not the lick
So she hears somebody wants some weight
All alone livin' in the A
That opportunist smell didn't take long to permeate
I'm nervous wait
So she tells her homies time to ride
Even freedom from the local cops
Hope Im not the lick
Im tryna' put her in her place and tell her
Stop killing these dreams
She's illegal so she's selling yay
Look both ways before you crossin' me
You just fucking up the murder rate
You're just what I want
Lick
And go and hide
I could feel you from across the street
And of course they wanna' cop from her
