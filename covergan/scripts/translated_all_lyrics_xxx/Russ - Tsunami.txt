If you wanna stand out gotta be outstanding
Own my own team, though
Everybody's in the same game, different levels with it
I'm in my own league, though
This is what you get when you don't care about the party scene
Same hell, different devils with it, yeah
It's very evident I know some shit you don't
mics use to mean something, nowadays I don't give a fuck
Am I the only one lifted?
Trying times doesn't mean it's time to stop trying
This is for my Spanish girls in Brooklyn screaming, "Papi"
I chew my beats and I spit out anthems
I see these leeches campin' out, it's like they live in tents
I move around with a handful of people that know they worth
But speaking of rent, I think we bout to lose the house
Too young for this wisdom, make them wanna check ID, though
I suggest you listen when I talk and shut your mouth
Making hooks like lay ups and verses like free throws
So pardon me if I don't really look amused
Whole album fire, I might call the shit, "Pyro"
The outcome of my input is my favorite review
Think they cuttin' off the lights, think they turnin' off the water
Better learn to swim lil' guppy
Feelin star struck every time I see my face
I'm just gassed off my drive, though
I'm too advanced for your advances, man, I'm feelin godly
I could go to Saudi, make racks a night
I need a smaller table and a bigger fence
Te quieres casar conmigo, yeah, they want me
About your magazine it means nothing
And I'm still turnin' down every single label offer
By the time this comes out, it's probably times the price
Top prospect, projected high draft pick
I do the work of two and half men like Charlie Sheen
I know what I gotta do to make my mom stop crying
I beat the game and I ain't even use a cheat code
All this winning by myself, got these labels all confused
I should do a deal with a Nike 'cause these checks are comin' soon, ooh
You hatin' from the stands, I'm ballin out, peep the seats, though
Oh that's crazy talk ain't it?
Russ is the wave, nah, Russ the tsunami
We understand that there's way more to life than just paying rent
I'm flying with wings that grew from leaps of faith
I change the world by example, not by my words
I'm just shootin' for the masses like I'm tryna make the news
What you gonna do if they don't send a boat
Think they repo-ing the cars, think we gotta sell the couch
Lemme tell you how my life feel
I been psychic, motherfuckers doubted
This past year has felt like a high light reel
Yeah, I pay my dues and get paid for it, too
The money ain't as fun when you're the only one with it
Ain't no playin us, we were born to make a dent
