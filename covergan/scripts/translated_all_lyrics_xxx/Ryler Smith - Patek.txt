Y'all acting like petty toddlers
All of my people they part of it
With subtle maneuvers we taking the tip of the berg
Livin off pennies why we remain humble
Tried to force it that shit was useless
From Harlem around the whole globe back up to New Jersey
Raising it up, the name public I summoned it
Ain't a man who been depending on better luck
Make sure these dials ain't wrong
Uh huh
Poppa always said money gon' turn most peeps to greed
From south of London to Shanghai
Found a new source of peace of mind
Gotta be said that contenders consuming him
Cousin verbally equipped son they love my function
Too dirty to groove with it
Make sure my mind my own
Stylin' on point you see no gold on my neck uh
Rappers get pushed back further no mercy
Ain't got no time for slow
When you forced a blue collar
Now I don't need excuses fuck y'all
Style irregular smoke the stash up presto
This shit for old school hustlers
Fuck your fake ass persona trace up no honor
Shit ain't all prada or gucci
Ain't got no time for those
With the armada always on time like patek
Trades of no customs stay bumpin'
In the jungle plenty snakes and piranhas try to slump you
Addicted like speed
Like dials right on the patek watch
I'm crazy so fuck with it
Bust it spread the mustard
Bust out the lewis a sudden intuitive feeling
Splittin the crumbles
Eat up at Benihana's
Gotta be clean or be bitter up on the rough
As we go to Bentley's from Honda's
I'm tipping no scale for these petty odds
See us get bigger with every bid that biddin' up
In those subways and busses uh
Niggas too dramatic always on point now partner
Sauce we whip it like pesto
Y'all want the new wave I'm giving em numerous
They get heated like saunas
Never finesse low (that's known)
