Drown to my end
Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting?
Such a big world, I always feel small
Maybe that's why he isn't listening yeah, yeah
Wish I can fly away, wish I can be in another place
Too many fucks we were not giving
No, I do not wanna sin
It's too late for mending
Yeah, save me, can't you see I'm melting
My demons, they lurk in the dark
Too many secrets I'll take to my grave
Now I'm gonna drown, drown
Save me
I need you to open your heart and show me a little of love
I feel like heaven's so far, yeah
Nobody cares, that's why they don't call
No, I do not wanna spark
You turn me into a spirit
I wish I'd known, I fell in love with the feelings
Thinking your chest isn't part of my stuff
I saw all my friends disappearing, what have you done?
While you living life without meaning
Really wanted to be safe but I'll accept my fate, yeah
Was it my fault?
I'm finna disappear with no chase
Everyone 'round me just want me to fall
Talking to God, like "I sent a message, why won't you respond?"
I don't need closure
