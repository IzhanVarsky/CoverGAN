The sky and stars and feeling a suggestion
We are the fire in the sky
In every city we live in
We make the hero forever and make each other the law
Cause the celebration into this life that you're slipping
Like the universe is a circle and its basic
Is the sky and stars and the poetry is just us
That we weren't all connected in the essence
Slip, sliding away and you know it's never enough
We take the day at it's worth, we speak the truth that we listen
And the resting place of the human race
We go first on a second
Its just us
We take the chance that we're given
And I never felt it before in the way that I feel it now
We are the poetry in motion
So until we meet again I am forever your friend
Of a final plan much bigger than us
We make the dream unreal, we make the rebel to god
You're begging for more and so on your knees you get up
Cause in the air that we breathe in create the life that we love
And the world spins round cause everything changes
Like a memory that you just can't touch
If the sky is the limit
Our earth is the blessing
We just move on a minute
Every second you're in it, every minute your guessing
Slip sliding with purpose into the black into
