Why are we here?
At all
When you walk away
Answer this question
That this is all
Why do we rise up
When it’s easier to fall?
What I never saw
Loving each other
That you’ve never been
And I know there’s something
I heard them say
Met in Your life...
And I feel it blow
To their pockets, and they’re
That when you dream
Still not happy
Every day
That what we see
Cause I can’t see
But I feel a breeze
You recognize
And it’s there to stay
Someone you never
Why do we move
Tell me the reason
It’s in your bloodstream
When it’s easy to stall?
Is what we got
Cause it’s still right there
And I feel it go
Why do we care?
It’s in your soul
You go to places
Walk away
That I just don’t know
And I feel it come
You cannot ignore it
Even when you
I seen them pray
