Yeah doesn't that mean that it's over
I try to say that I could never go back to what we were
Sometimes it feels like you, oh
'cause he kisses me right too
Sometimes it feels like you
Is it all the way over
Doesn't that mean that it's over
Doesn't that mean that, mean that, mean that it's over
I guess that's how it should, it's been over a year since you and me

Yeah, I don't want to admit that

I want to tell him what he wants

I kinda wanna fall for you all the way over
That it's all the way over

Yeah, I still can't commit 'cause
But I don't want to admit that
This could be something new

I don't even believe that when
