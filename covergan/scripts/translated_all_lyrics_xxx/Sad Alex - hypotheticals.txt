Clothes i wear, acted like i didn't care
Would you love me then, baby would you love me?
Is she glad to have you back, have you around?
Me?
But maybe if I cut my hair, changed up all the
Not usually the jealous type
'til I'm drinking I'm a shot away from hitting you up
You can't tell me that she's better sucking your (uh)
I'm not perfect but we had our moments
I know I'm hard to love
Hometown?
I made, turned around our old mistakes
So stupid these hypotheticals
Now you're not lying next to me
And feeling guilty
Got me taking bad advice
(I barely trust myself)
Now I'm brushing my teeth
Wear, acted like I didn't care

Are you hanging with that girl from your
Maybe if I cut my hair, changed up all the clothes I
Maybe if I changed my face, owned up to the mess
Just wanna see what you're up to
Don't you think it's about time that you unblocked
Sober thinking that I might be better off
Sleeping ugly
Is she a red hot lover like her lipstick?
I know it's hard to trust me I can
'Cause you're not lying next to me
Barely trust myself
My minds running
