I got a glass half empty in my mind
In my mind
It follows me in the room
So fucking sad I know
With a love addiction, so
I'll try to be good tomorrow
With a love addiction I cannot quit
I feel a cloud full of doom
Find a bad boy distraction
I don't got shit to say
But for tonight I'm being me
Kiss me
(Kiss me)
Crying into a bottle
So fuckin' sad
I got a glass half empty
(Know what makes me)
Why do you ask me to smile
Can you stay for a while?
Let's numb the pain together, babe
All the time
When I don't wanna smile?
Cause I'm a cynical, clinical, cyclical bitch
Excuses for all my actions
I hear them asking "what's wrong?"
You can't get through to me
I know you're scared of me, but
I'm so fucking sad all the time
I've been this way for so long
