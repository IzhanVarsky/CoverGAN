When it comes to love
Oh Lord, oh Lord
That's not the way I feel at all
Only for you, you
And you should hold your breath from behind your texts
Oh, When it comes to you
(Only for you)
When it comes to you
And advice is something I can live without
When it comes to us
Gonna call when I make it home
Oh, Why do I interrupt
And I was running like I do
So bored when I'm on my own because of you
And I know you can't even think right now
My heart's beating upon my sleeve
A second guess, all the things, they're right around my head
Try'na to teach you things you already knew
Try'na figure out if you mean the things you do
Oh, hell no
(Pitch shift sample: "Do-Beating")
It was a question, not an accusation
No more, no less, than chemicals and pheromones
A play on words just to change your face
If I make you feel like I want more
Only for you
Make you feel you're not enough
