Tell me what I have to do
Love, I know you must be tired
A place for us to make ourselves a home
Here's the place where we will rest
Give me everything you have
Travelling this empty road alone
In this house
I can make a space
Oh my god
I could fall in love with you
You never have to leave
You and me
In this house, in this house
And here is where we'll cry
Here's the place where we will love
Bring what you can hold
To travel all this way
For the ones we leave behind
And oh my god
And happily we'll die
After years of summertime
All I have is yours to give
I'm happy to accommodate you
But I can see
Tell me what I have to do, to fall in love with you
