Shifts into place
This feeling's automatic
Won't tell no lie
Don't know how it will turn out
Just you, and me
(When I'm here with you)
When I'm hanging out with you
Still automatic
I feel the same
Although I'm growing older
What you do to me makes me feel alive
When it's you
Coming over me
When it's you, and me
It's automatic
This is how I feel
But I'm hoping it will last (oh oh oh)
And me
I can feel it now
It feels like, it's automatic
It's you
When I'm rolling with you, still automatic
Ah-ah ah-ah
