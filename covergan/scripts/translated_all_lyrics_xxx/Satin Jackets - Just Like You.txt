Just like you
Suddenly the party's where I knew you'd be
Still you managed to bring out the best of me
I couldn't stop thinking we saw differently
On the couch
Every time
Why is it so hard to stay away?
Became so much more important to me
You and I
But you said you felt I'm in love with you too
Talk all night
You broke my heart when I broke yours into two
I told you many times I'm not like you
To realise I want you
If I could do it I would undo that I had to lose you
I think it got me thinking just like you
