With a face made for TV
There’s a part of me you’ll take away forever
Better than I was before
Well, I want you to know that I am doing
Even if I want to
I knew it was only just a matter of time
And our delicate youth is starting to get old
I see you in the papers, I go to all your plays
If you’re in Manchester will you come to my show?
It ain't easy to forget you
I’m on your news feed twice a day
You bring your hair and makeup to my flat
So, how you doing?
And even if I want to, I can't look away
How you doing?
I’d like to say hello and
Well, I want you to know
And say
That really
You were caught in the headlights of your dream
And I just want to know
I can't look away
But that was a while ago
While you’re putting on pearls
If you’re in town tonight
And that would do
It’s all I want to hear you say
'Cause I’m still working shifts
Sometimes I dream about you running away
Your body shape was a warning sign
Oh, heaven on earth is a hell of a place
I want to hear you say
Now we live in different worlds
No one can judge me for trying to get back
