So is this done? Have you won?
I feel everything in ways uncharted (Ways uncharted)
Is this where we say goodbye?
Why can't I just l–µave you behind?
You made your point
Will I be able to live on my own?

Did I lose? Will I run?
I've tried and tried to fall out of love
I'm just disregarded (I'm just disregarded)
I'm not iron hearted (I'm not iron hearted)
