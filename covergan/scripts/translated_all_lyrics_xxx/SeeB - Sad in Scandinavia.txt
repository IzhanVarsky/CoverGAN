Feel about you now
So sad
Just can't get away from you
Over all the nights with you
I'd go anywhere if it would give me peace of mind
Wish I could change the way I feel about you now
I don't know how to let you go
Can't stand the rain and I
Looking at a stranger, and I see your silhouette
How'd you run away from someone you can't leave behind?
Some days I'm so close to moving on that I forget
Paint myself a future where the happiness would last
I travelled all this way so I could cover up the past
Counting the days 'til I'm
Got me feeling sad in Scandinavia
Get that familiar feeling of a tightness in my chest
Feel about you now, oh
So sad for you
Wish I could fight the way I feel about you now
I don't know if I could let you go
I'm still holding on to all the baggage that you left
Now I'm feeling sad in Scandinavia
