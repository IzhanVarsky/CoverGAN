My safe zone
Been taking me forever
I avoid goin' out on a Saturday night, mm, mm
I don't think that I can handle to see your face
Would be no way out
I hide inside my walls
Know my head, know my heart
Of this state of mind
'Cause you don't wanna see me on the other side
My own, my safe zone
And the one place you don't go
In the one place you don't go (Go, go, go, go)
Still don't know what I'd say if I saw you today, mm, mm
Stacking notes to myself but I know that won't help, mm, mm
'Cause you know me way too well
To get over what we had, yeah
Is the one place you don't go
So don't take me out
'Cause the bars that I like is where your friends hanging out, mm, mm
Behind my skin and bones
Let me hide inside my walls
