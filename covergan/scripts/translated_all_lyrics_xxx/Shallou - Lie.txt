Fight then we break up
Lie, lie, lie to me
Guess you don't care that much
And every little word you say
Kiss then we make up
Like I don't even have a clue
What's happening
Tearing my heart in two, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every little thing you do
It's like you chew me up
And then you spit me ou-ou-out
Too stuck in the air
But you don't got guts to look me in the face
Keep saying we're the perfect two
You lie, lie, lie to me
You got my heart on all these different chains
I can't try to change you
We're too busy living seperate lives
Like I don't know what's happening
Keep saying I'm your everything
Caught me in a hurricane
A hurricane
Keep tearing my heart in two
Just wanna mess me u-u-up
The way you keep playing me, no fair, oh
What's happening, oh-oh-oh
Act like you would do anything
And no matter what I do
Act like it's only me and you
It's driving me too insane now, oh
When we keep going nowhere
