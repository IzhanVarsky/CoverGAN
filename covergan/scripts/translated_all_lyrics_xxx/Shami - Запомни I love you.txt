Now I'm up for you
These gossip, pride, girlfriends
We will run away with you
You are my little, you are my little
Far apart again
I saw in the eyes of this sincere fear
I can't stand on my feet without you, you are my universe
The sweetest, the most tender
I'll take your hand, squeeze it tight
You don't know me I'm just a fool
You are my land
I know you're in pain
Understand that I...
Remember, I love you, lo-lo-lo-lo-love you
All that was, know not on purpose, but I did not want to lie to you
Understand that I need you, nee-nee-need you, love you
Distance - I don't care
Now you are mine forever
So tired of getting used to
Palagin on the beat!
Decided to play with you
It's sad you don't want to understand
You and I are one
