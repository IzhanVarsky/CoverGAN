You say we're just friends
And I hope it meant something to you (Oh)
Sapphire moonlight
For ya (Oh, she loves it when I call)
The air was hot from summer rain
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop
Land in Miami
All along, I've been coming for ya (For you)
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
We danced for hours in the sand
Don't ya let me fall, oh
Ooh, I should be runnin'
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya (So damn hard to leave ya)
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
It's true, la-la-la
Locked in the hotel
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
It's true, la-la-la (True la-la)
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
Tequila Sunrise
There's just some things that never change
For ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la (La, la, la)
Coming for ya (Coming for you)
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
I love it when you call me señorita
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Sweat drippin' off me
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya (Coming for you)
