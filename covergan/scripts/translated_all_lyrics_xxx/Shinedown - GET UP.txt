To tell you everything's A-okay
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long?
And I agree you can do much better, trust me
Sometimes you're wrong... sometimes you're right
Get up, get up, what's takin' so long
Yeah, I don't know why I never talk about it
And medication don't do much
If you were ever in doubt
So, take it from me, you're not the only one
Today, tomorrow, and the next
Ain't nothin' normal when it comes to you and me
Yeah
I know you're clingin' to the light of day
Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong
Yeah, it just numbs the brain
I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams
Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
Get up, get up, get a move on
So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
Get up, get up, get up, get up
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
But you gotta try, so I'm callin' out
And I agree you can do much better, trust me (Trust me)
I'm just gonna keep movin'
Guess you might say I'm a little intense
Get up, get up
Who can't see straight (Can't see straight)
Stop stallin', I'm callin' out
Everybody wants to sing their song
I guess that's probably part of the problem
But you gotta try, and I'm callin' out
Just gotta keep movin'
I'm on the bright side of bein' hell bent
