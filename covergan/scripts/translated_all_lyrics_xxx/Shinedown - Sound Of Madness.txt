You can sleep with a gun
Bringin' up the past
But I'm not, gonna part the seas
You've been infected by a social disease
Always comin' in last
You think, that by cryin' to me
Wrote the book on pain
But when you gonna wake up and fight
I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
No one owes you anything
Oh my, here we go
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You've been infected, by a social disease
I think you need a shotgun blast
You think that by cryin' to me
I'm still laughin' like hell
So paranoid, watch your back
I created the sound of madness
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
Quicksand's got no sense of humor
Yeah, I get it you're an outcast
A kick in the ass
Another loose cannon gone bipolar
And fight
Well I created the sound of madness
For yourself
To explain
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
Always under attack
Somehow I'm still here
But when you gonna wake up... when you gonna wake up
You're a self-fulfilling prophecy
When you gonna wake up and fight
Well, then take your medicine
