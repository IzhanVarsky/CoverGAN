Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Standing together, we can do anything
The rain, it falls, rain, it falls
You're not alone in all this
World, I want to leave you better
Pouring on me
Standing together we can do anything
You're not alone, I promise
I am afraid to let you see the real me
You don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds
We don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds
You’re not alone, I promise
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Have I the courage to change?
I want my life to matter
World, you're not alone in all this
I watch the news on TV
You’re not alone in all this
I want to leave you better
Rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
I am afraid I have no purpose here
Abandon myself daily
