I'm, too restless still waiting for something to change us with fate
While, you're going back to the habits you had before mine
Everyone keeps on coasting
I'll take anything that will force me to make up my mind
Won't be long now
Try to break it all down
You, called me to say things are different but I'm still the same
Everything keeps on floating
Pretend I'm nowhere around
Save it for the morning
