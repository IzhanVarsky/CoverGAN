This is your world, just put the fear back in their eyes
Hey now, don't be afraid to fight for something
Get yourselves together!
Speak out, don't let the status quo define you
Even if they anger you, get yourselves together
Look now, what have they sold you
Get yourself together!
Wake up, this could be your finest hour
(Rise!)
Stand up and live your life!
There comes a time when you know there's a problem
Get yourselves together
Rise up, it's a dawn of a new day
Hands up, it's gonna be okay
This is your chance, and you can stand for so much more
Rise up, it's the dawn of a new day
Even when they strangle you, get yourselves together
Clear your throat now
Hands up, hands up high
Pick your head up, and get your body off the floor
You can cough for their demise
Strike down all that oppose you
Stand up to the devil slowly rising
Stand up and live your life
