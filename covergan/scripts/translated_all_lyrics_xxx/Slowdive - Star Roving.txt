Emma flies a kite
Ooh, ooh
Nothing left to lose
Can't hold down tonight
Give it away now, girl
Nothing left to fight
Said she's feeling love for everyone tonight
Smiling beautiful
She says I make it best for everyone tonight
Said she's feeling good, said she's feeling good
For everyone to hide
Although possible
Every black and white
She says I make it best
Secret's seeking light
In a flash of time
Secret's a blinking light
Can't hold on to mine
Twisting around my girl
