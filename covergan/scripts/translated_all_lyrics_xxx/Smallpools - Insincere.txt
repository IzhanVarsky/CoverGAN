Up and elevate your life
But my head ain't feeling right
Will we ever get outta here?
And it haunts me day and night
Dream me, stream me, glued to the TV
But without the keys, stuck at the door
And will the hounds come and sniff me out?
My mind is out of sight
And will the hounds come and sniff me out? (Hey!)
I'm sorry, sorry to kill the vibe
And we'll never get outta here
The words are never clear
It seems that I've been here before
Build me, kill me, right click to fill me
They're always insincere
And always insincere
I started something I couldn't stop
And I'll never get outta here
(Will we ever get outta here?)
