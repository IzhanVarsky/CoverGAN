I can do no wrong
I used to be a skeptic non-believer
But I fell hard for what just blew in off the coast
The richest love ain't growing on the trees out here
But confidently, I can say I'm sold
So I thought I could love nothing but the breeze here
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
A bullseye from a dart
The ceiling's just the start
Some people say there's nothing really real here
But now it's changed, you're worth your weight in gold
Salt drips from her brow
Got all my money on you
Reaching for a star
And though my dollars are few
We'll keep going strong
I've got all my money on you
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks
They paint it like a sun without a soul
No more days without
I feel like a million bucks
State I'm in right now
Stay all-in right now
Makes me feel so right
