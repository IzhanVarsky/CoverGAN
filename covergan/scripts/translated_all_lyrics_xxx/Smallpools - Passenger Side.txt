Cause it's hot as a mother
Are you riding with your top down
I could steer from the passenger side
And we may not find partners in crime
Losing your mind and you don't know why
On quest for new lovers yeah
While you slip your bra
When I think back to the ways
As we fall from each other
And I know what's dead is gone
So if you're alone just watching the sky
Blast our favorite songs
I miss those desert drives
Weekend bracelets on
Got sweat on each other yeah
But there's something holding on
From the passenger side
Get me through state lines
From your cracked iPhone
From your ripped t shirt
Precious cargo rides
With somebody else now
Does he keep you in the lines
Where I would steer
Better in life than we've had this whole time
And I wonder where you are now
I miss those Vegas lights
While you switch the song
And you wanna try going for one more ride
I feel that you might have always been right
