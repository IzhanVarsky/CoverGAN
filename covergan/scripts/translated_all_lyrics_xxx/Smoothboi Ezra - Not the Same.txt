I’m so paranoid thanks to you
But you don’t know my name anymore
When you think of having fun
I hope you’re doin fine
We just grew apart
While we went on a walk
It doesn’t roll off your tongue
Who have you been telling my secrets to
But I could listen to you talk
So friendship was I don’t know where we are
I’m afraid you’d won’t pick up so I’d just leave it how it is
Are you doing alright tonight?
It’s not the same but I don’t know what I’m asking for
Don’t think anything happened
I wouldn’t know I haven’t talked to you in a while
I would call you up but I’m too anxious
