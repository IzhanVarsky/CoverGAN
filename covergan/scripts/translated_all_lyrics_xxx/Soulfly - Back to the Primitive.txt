The god will guide me
Check your reality
We're back to set it free
We got our life to live
The way we want to be
How it used to be
Confronting the negative
Primitive
Fuck all you wannabe's
Fuck all your bullshit
Fuck all your politics
Fuck all your wannabes
Let it bleed!
Back to the primitive
What we want to be
Forever we will be
Um, Dois, TrÃªs, Quatro
Who feels it, knows it
Primitivo
You don't mean shit to me
Aaaaaarggghhh!
