The one that could fill your fantasies
That girl is the gun to my holster
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Someday, I wanna make you my wife
Remember the first time we met
(That I can't keep out, got me singin' like)
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again
You was at the mall with your friends
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
I'm in the kitchen cooking what she like
I was scared to approach ya
She's running through my mind all day, yeah
See you been all around the globe
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
I can be your melody
Na, na, na, na, everyday
A guy that could write you a symphony
Not once did you leave my mind
That we would ever be more than friends
Girl, you really changed my life
Shawty's like a melody in my head
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Who would have ever knew
Doing things I never do
But then you came closer
That girl, like something off a poster
Hopin' you would give me a chance
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me (ayy)
