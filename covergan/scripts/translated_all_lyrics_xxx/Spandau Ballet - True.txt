Always slipping from my hands
This is the sound
I know this much is true
Oh, I want the truth to be said
(Huh huh uh-huh hi)
Know this much is true
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
So true, funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
I bought a ticket to the world
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
This much is true
I know, I know, I know this much is true
Huh huh uh-huh hi
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
This is the sound of my soul
But now I've come back again
Sand's a time of its own
Head over heels when toe to toe
Oh, I want the truth to be known
