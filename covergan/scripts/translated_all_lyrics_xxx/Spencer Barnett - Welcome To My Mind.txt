I live in my head I'm in here all alone
You can make all okay, all okay, all okay
You make me wanna change, wanna change, wanna change
Hearing things I think I've gone delirious
My head is so haunted
So you can see what it's like
Welcome to my mind
Where I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
Keeping me awake every day, every day
I don't know why I always act so serious
But I'm turning off all of these lights
I know I should clean it before I let you see it
So I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
It's a little dark sometimes
Let nobody in I'm better on my own
I'm afraid to be honest
Overthinking every day, every day, every day
In my head I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
Wanna come down but I'm falling too far
Up on this cloud, up in the stars
