(Love me wild)
Rolling in the deep while we're still
Burn the city just
If chaos is what you like
We'll burn the city just
Burn the city just you and I
It's just us tonight
Let me fall apart
(I need you now)
(It's just us tonight)
I need you to love me wild
We'll burn thе city just you and I
To find me in the dark
I'll do just what you like baby
We'll burn the city just you and I
I need you
Can you find me now?
Where we don't get to escape for a little while
Drowning in the moonlight
We'll burn the city
I like feeling you beneath me
(Burn them down)
It's just us
Hiding from the life
Sink into these sheets
We'll start a fire
We'll start a firе
(If chaos is what you like)
(Burn the city down)
(It's just us)
