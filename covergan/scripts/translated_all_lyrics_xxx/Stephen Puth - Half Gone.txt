Might just heal all this pain
Oh, you took every piece
I gave you all my time, now it's yours; isn't mine, no
Lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight
But that wasn't enough and I don't understand why
And the one that I need is you all along
I thought time and some space
(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)
How could I be so blind? Captivated by those eyes
There's not enough left for me to move on
And the more I got to know you, the more you would get from me
How can I love? Yeah
Yeah, you took every piece
Well, you had all my love in the palm of your hand
'Cause you stole all the love from the palm of my hand
Oh, my heart is half gone
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah
I lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight
(When my heart is half gone)
How can I love when my heart's half gone?
But the one that I needed was you all along
