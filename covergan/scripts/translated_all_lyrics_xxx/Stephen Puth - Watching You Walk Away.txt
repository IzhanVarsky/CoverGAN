Yeah, I wonder where you go (Wonder where you go)
I see it in your eyes
One more night and it's something more
I don't know what ya do alone (Do alone)
I wake up and you're out the door
Yeah, I wonder where you go
I don't know what ya do alone
I know it's getting late, yeah
Know we said no expectations, but we got some, we got some
Yeah, you leave before, I ask you to stay
Are you with somebody else?
That I don't care if I see you again
You to stay
Yeah, you leave before I ask you to stay
It's like we're always keeping secrets
I can feel the hesitation in between us
Try to play it down but it gets harder to pretend
Bet that you look even better in the daylight
Why do we only get together after midnight?
You know it kills me every time
Know we said don't want no pressure, yeah, it's alright, it's alright
Makin' empty conversation, it's a problem
So you leave before I ask you to stay
I say what's up, love?
Watching you walk away
