But there ain’t no rush
Breathe like all the drugs that we on
Leave me out to dry like the wind though, oh
Every whisper spells out your love, oh
Wake up every morning like
On and on the feeling go
Don’t you wrap me around in fables
Darling did I do too much
Yeah I miss you
Don’t you lay me on the tablе
Sit here for a minute outside
And I’m feeling every whisper
Cold to the touch, now it’s no more
Singing sentimental or worse
Yеah I miss you
Did I fuck up, did I say too much
Don’t you lay me on the table
Darling why’d I wish too much
