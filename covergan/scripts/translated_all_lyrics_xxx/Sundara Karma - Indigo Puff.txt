I see the sound land on my skin
Take me where the sun shines from my mind
And drive towards the place we left behind
I'm open now and feeling free
Indigo puff
Load up the guns
In time I, in time I, in time I...
You're the one who keeps me on my own
Take it in right
In my heart, in my bones, in my soul
A passion moves me from within
Open your mind
Running through my brain
I feel the light surrounding me
And breathe into your hungry appetite
Now we're higher than the eastern skies
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
In my heart, in my bones and in my soul
It's in my brain
