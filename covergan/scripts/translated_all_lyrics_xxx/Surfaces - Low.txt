Why won't you listen when I say it's all that's left of me?
Do you ever feel that way?
Lord, I know I pray on broken knees
I can't fake what I'm dreaming of
Try to talk but keep on mumbling
This feel fits me like a broken glove
I'm findin' peace in a pocket full of memories
Oh this world is way too cold for me
And this coat won't fix this over freeze
Can't you hear me from up above?
Yeah, I been feelin' low
Seems like hell's freezing over, love
Try to run but keep on stumbling
Oh, this world is way too much for me
Ohh
Findin' love in a head full of melodies
Will I ever be okay?
