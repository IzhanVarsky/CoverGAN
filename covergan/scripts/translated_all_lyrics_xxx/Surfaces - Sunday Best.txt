Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Everyone falls down sometimes
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
It's okay, it's okay
Good, feeling good
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
