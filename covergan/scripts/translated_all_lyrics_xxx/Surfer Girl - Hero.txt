The oracle Apollo
Has an identity crisis
Lets not resort to violence
Thunderstorms and locusts
Smoking that shit that get you on the floor
Compassion levels zero
But the pressures forming diamonds
The change come from within
Dipped in gold, you think you hold the title of the pharaoh
If you’ve really got heart and soul
Now it’s bow and arrows
We say this is crazy but have no control so we
There’s no captain to steer the ship
Has seen tomorrow
The system is broken let’s open our mind
I sip and I sip til that shit go hollow
Lack of concentration
Grab your lighters and put them up and say:
The coppers are out, man they’re back on patrol
It’s a tough pill to swallow
They’re harassing some people, and letting some go
Jewelry stores are closing
When A first world nation
Is the television broken
“our president don’t know shit”
We were on the straight and narrow
Brains is on the islands
Humans losing focus
Money is power, but dasshity blind
Caligula and Nero
Tough act to follow
We celebrate differences but look inside
How come nobody is smiling?
Put our hands up, all we need is a hero
If you’re really bout peace and love
Captive of devices
Hard to stay afloat with rising tides and rising prices
And you’re sick and tired of this storm just say:
We have to come together but you’d rather be divisive
I am the same as every other guy
Believe it or not all we need is a hero
