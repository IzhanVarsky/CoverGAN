There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My father said
I still remember how it all changed
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
Yeah
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
Up on the hill across the blue lake
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
That's where I had my first heartbreak
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
