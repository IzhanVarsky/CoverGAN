save me
In the diary of the two forgotten
This nightmare I have every night
go through the dream again
Your hand almost caught
the meaning of this sad dream
Don't go breaking my heart, don't go (Breaking my heart)
never ending rhythm
My heart is locked in a maze of memories (Ah-ah-ah)
My heart is locked in a maze of memories
In the two forgotten diaries (inside, oh-oh)
Save me (Save me, oh)
nightmare dance
I want to end this world
fragmented world
The growing gap between you and me
This darkness swallowed the scream
Take me to that secret (Woah, woah)
This graffiti spread before my eyes
Don't go breaking my heart, don't go
I opened my eyes that night
the day it rained
take me to that secret
please stop
name that wanders around the mouth
tell me now
In the deepest place of an eternal dream
Sleeping blue secret
