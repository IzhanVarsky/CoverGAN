Put your hands up in the air where I can see them
Hoodoo guru now I ask for your direction, please
You don't even know me
Why don't you tie the noose
Lock me inside of your cage
My heart was filled with sin
And there's a natural mystik in the air
Run circles through the senses wave
You see I suffocate myself at night, drowning in my dreamin'
There's a natural mystik in the air
And turn the lights down slowly
Come closer to the knife
Rhythm healer is your false defeater
Oh I learn about your sacrifice
Lonesome wandering soul walked the earth, my heart was bare
I kissed the ground, no I was never found
Ah, ah, yeah
Voodoo truth
And darling, you were looking at me with that innocent stare
I guess I laid my ego to rest
Said are you real and do you feel, and are you really there?
I'm seeking the truth within
No, I forgot my peace when I knew it was there
