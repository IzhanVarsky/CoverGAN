Pump it up a little more
Pump it up Yo! Pump it!
Make my, make my day
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
Yo! Pump it
And you'd find out if you do that
Make my, make my make my day
I don't want
And you'll find out if you're too bad
Yo! Pump it!
While your feet are stomping
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
Make my day, yo
Look at here the crowd is jumpin'
A place to stay
Make my, make my, make
Pump it up
Pump up the jam Pump it
I want
Pump up the jam
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
And the jam is pumping
See, cause that's where the party's at
Pump it
Yo! Pump up the jam
