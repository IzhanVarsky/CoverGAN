(Where I don't sleep alone) Now the memories fade, turning into stone
I take back everything I said when the world was not my friend
Swinging for defense so regret won't follow
What a hard pill to swallow
A place that I call home
(When the world was not my friend)
Cause that's a tough pill to swallow
You'll never break me down
Overthought it all since I was years old
Hard to break the mold and bet it in my bones
(Where I don't sleep alone)
Where I don't sleep alone
(I quit, I've had enough of this)
I'm searching for a place that I call home
(Getting high in my room every weekend)
Looking back at the light I thought I knew so well
To feel like I belong
From birth to death I thought I _______
Scared to swing for defense so regret would follow
I've waited for so long
So I justify what life signifies
