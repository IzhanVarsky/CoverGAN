Fools believe they can erase
If God won't forgive me
Cheats try to judge me
Friends wanna kill me
I'm not the only one to make amends
But I give them all my loving anyway
Try to understand it's only 'cause I can
Mother, it's not in my hands
But I don't wanna be that son
I'm tired of bowing to preachers all the time
Can't find something to believe in
But I'm crawling out of the ceiling
Mother
Friends say I gotta see reason
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
But I can see the sins that stain your smile
I'm tired of bowing to preachers
All that they've done wrong
I'm crawling out of the ceiling
