What's at the root of it?
Worries on all sides of my mind
Outside my windows fall
Of course, I was forced to retreat
Covering the light I thought I'd see
I don't have a need to speak
Accolades and happy days
Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me
Stories of courage clouded up with fear
They don't ever last
I don't see the bright side, quite as clear
From Victory, I tried
From victory I accept defeat
To match eternal light with how I lead my life
Am I sad or am I sick?
In the broom grass I would l lie
In silence, my darkness is denied
Waxy green and yellow walls
From victory, I tried
Something tells me no
I don't write 'cause I don't think
Do I throw my hands and quit?
