The light in the darkness, the voice from th–µ undergroung
With you I can always go higher
Right now, this is us, this is power
Our pure domination will not be misunderstood
We live to win, got nothing to lose
The light of your soul demands and the world responds
So very strong, above and beyond
You're ruling the moment that everyone tries to seize
You are my queen, the killer machine
I feel you loud without a sound
Together we're taking what's ours
You're my electric desire
