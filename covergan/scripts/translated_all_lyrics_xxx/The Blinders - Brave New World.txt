The year of Ford
He build a wall, and he built it high
Watch them change a dozen laws
From us all
The TV culture in hyperdrive
The brave new world takes its first sip
Forgotten teachings, the son of a sin
The Kardashians on a wild acid trip
Feet keep marching towards your demise
But did you know that it's made out of pie?
Watch them snatch it from us all
Watch them take it from the poor
The fog moves and I'm struggling to think
Marching men with bewitched eyes
It's a trip
Oh to be, from the land of the free
Heads now working in disguise
Hear the sound of dystopian cries
Watch them build it from the floor
My eyes in my brain
In come, The Idiot King
And my head's in the sink
Oh-Ah, it's a brave new world
A light happening where it doesn't exist
To the jungle bar, babe
