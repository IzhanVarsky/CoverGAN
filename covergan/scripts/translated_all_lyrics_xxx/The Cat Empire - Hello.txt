In the midst of the slumber, I heard some footsteps creeping
And the waves were a-rolling like the curves on those legs
Oh, hello, hello
Some like money making, some like cars
Welcome to this night, welcome to this song
On my head was a hoodie, in my ears was some bass
Come towards me, with a little cheeky smile
She knelt down beside, said, "Can I share your pillow?"
And some like to gossip about some rich sugar daddies
That's a little strange if you're asking me
Of the sweet beach bella with that centrefold spread
Ah, hello, hello
And some like watching people living on TV
I rolled over and I said
Whoa, hello, hello
The fire brigade, or zero-zero-zero
Welcome to these rhymes that be going on and on
That were causing an extension to the towel and my bed
She stopped me in my tracks and I said
Hello, hello
I was walking by my dog when I saw that sexy face
Pablo, Pablo
Walking down the street with some evil in my eye
If she was a phone, I'd pick her up and dial
But me and my friends, we like the golden brown honeys
'Cause I like to eat and laugh and fuck and play down low
And some like the houses with the rooftop spas
But most of all, welcome to the bellas in this room
These are the things I know
And I woke to discover the woman I'd been dreaming
Well, hello, hello
Mm, hello, hello
I was sleeping in the sand with some dreams in my head
Welcome to the empire and the funky empire tunes
And some thoughts in my head that were making me feel high
