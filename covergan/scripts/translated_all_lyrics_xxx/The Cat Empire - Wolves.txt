You got a look in your eye
Going to run like wolves
Slit the moon with a knife
But baby til then I'll watch the world turn
Like cut diamond time
And maybe one day we'll all stand still
You could light up the sky
To get cornered and tired
We're going to run like wolves
And watch the sun fall down over that hill
Step into the night
Like gunshots in signs
I'll watch the world turn
I didn't come here tonight
All the drums in a line
But baby til then
Sing Staying Alive
Watch the world turn
Where no light can ever return
They sparkle and shine
Well the ghosts by my side
