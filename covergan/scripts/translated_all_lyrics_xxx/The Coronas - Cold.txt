Think of me when you feel ok
I can't pretend that I planned it out
Just a bit unkind
Just witnessed the words falling right out of my mouth
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold
I didn't think, I just talked I couldn't turn it off
Do we trust ourselves that much?
They don't know what to say
Or give me a reason to see you anyway
I never told you enough what that means
Just a few hundred doubts, I'm cold...
Gimme a reason to see you anyway
A cold chill on my shoulder
Even our friends are more than amazed
When I go I won't like you less
Gimme a reason to feel ok
We never got to say goodbye
I'm too proud
And the night won't allow
It came as some surprise
I'm too proud and the night won't allow
No the night won't allow
I'm cold but I will not show it
It's not too loud
How do we know?
A cold, it's not too loud
Though it seems I'm still streets ahead
You look at me the way I want to be seen
It wasn't a fake, it wasn't a lie
