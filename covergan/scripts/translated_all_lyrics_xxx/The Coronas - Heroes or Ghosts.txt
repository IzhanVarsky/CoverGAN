There's nowhere we'd rather be
And you know these roads, they could take us to the start
It's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
Heroes or ghosts
But I, I know, it's gonna take a lot of time and a little bit of luck
One man's mood can break another man's soul
I've seen a reaction, now we've so much to prove
I've seen a reaction, yeah I've watched us improve
We'll get there if we should
Am I too scared to say, we'll get there if we should
So here we go
It's harder than it looks, it's harder than it looks
But this is what we've got
But this is what we've got and there's nowhere we'd rather be
And you know, you know
And you know, oh yeah, you know
Or am I just too cynical for my own good
But it's beginning to happen, it's beginning to move
That it's harder than it looks, it's harder than it looks
And there's nowhere we'd rather be
And you could say we don't care or that we don't believe
So don't grow old, forgetting who you are
From the shadows you've cast to play the part
But this is what we've got and there's nowhere
A simple goal could get you very far
