Looks like it's one of those things that just can't be ignored
It's just easy
Look at us we're nervous now but it feels kinda cool
Don't talk about the future or past mistakes
Well I'm so glad
Both careful cause we're hurting from past mistakes
And I nearly just said something there it might be too soon
Just like my card tricks
Are you still mad?
Then we're both screwed just on purpose
I've never seen LA before at night from this high
And it's a big if
Let's dance around that
We're careful but we're open yeah we're gonna be okay
And if it's too soon
Ah-ah
It's gonna be ok
You couldn't make this shit up
But I think we're almost certain yeah we're gonna be ok
So take me to your favourite place nearby
Keep it breezy
It's not a fake laugh
And who wants to fall in love
Did you find it all a little too hard?
All the cynics stand up
And we'll both lie down right here on this floor
They're not perfect
It never seems to be enough
