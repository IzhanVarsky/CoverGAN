No you wouldn't have minded
Am I freaking out?
How could I ever miss the changing of your heart
But I’d never deceive no I’d never deceive you love
Remember when you said we'd never fall apart ah
You don't mind it though, you just light me up
Or can I press restart?
Can I get a reaction, gimme something I can say
Cause we're losing all the things that made us good
Well I don't wanna believe I don't wanna believe I would
Cause I'm screaming all these things inside my mouth
Have you had enough?
Can I get a reaction, gimme me something I can say
I wanna believe yeah I wanna believe them now
Was it something that you saw
Am I just scared?
You always liked the way I talked
At least we agree to disagree on that ah
I think it's somewhere in my flaws
We don't have to say if we're having a good time
You tell me I made it, but I'm feeling kinda strange
But I'd never give up no I'd never give up on us oh
That I'll never be as strong without you there
And if I could just find it
That everything we built has gone beyond repair
You never tried to cut me off
