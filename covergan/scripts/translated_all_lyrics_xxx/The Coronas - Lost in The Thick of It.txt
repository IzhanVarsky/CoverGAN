I've gotta face it alone
Hoping you don't notice it when I'm
I guess that's when we drifted you're right
Do do do duh
Just a bit low-spirited, I gotta face it alone
I hate to say that I'm wrong
The way you walked away, it really messed me up
We used to be addicted one time
Walk until our feet hurt sometime
'Cause we're only growing, not unfolding (Sometime)
We couldn't even fake it one time
Just a bit low-spirited, and I, I gotta face it alone
There must be nothing you've left to prove
I didn't need it, I said enough
I'm good for a little bit (Just a bit low spirited)
Won't make it better I could never do it all
Maybe we could meet up sometime
I'll say I'm guilty if it brings me back to you
Do do do duh do doo
And I hope you know it's never over
Get lost in the thick of it, sometimes
Feels better playing along
Get lost in the thick of it sometimes
Hoping you don't notice it (Just a bit low spirited)
Get lost in the thick of it
Do do do do doo
Turn it into something that you never wanna lose
I want a lawyer, give me a good lawyer too
I tried to salvage, left it alone
I'm good for a little bit, but I
Just a little knees-up sometime
Just a bit low-spirited, and I
