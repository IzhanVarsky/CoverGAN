I guess I'm jealous a lot
I force things even to their end
But the world made me afraid of
As I watched you somehow self-destruct
You're still my favourite
I think we've been through enough
And I'm not able
Why didn't you tell us your mind?
What's that? I'm not making sense
Say your goodbyes, tell 'em you're tired oh
To love
Did you even know?
You'rе still my favourite
What's that? You're not making sense
(Don't try to change it, don't try to change it)
Music's too loud I can barely hear you
'Cause I warned myself that these things might come up
(Don't try to change it)
Twice now I said I've had enough
Remind me again why we keep coming here
As I watched you somehow sеlf-destruct
How could you not know?
You're my favourite
Now at least we found a good excuse to love
I suppose we got to take it
I forced things to their detriment
Get your attention, you already know
Well I guess I'm jealous a lot
