But I blacked out all the memories
You have to go to erasе me
I don't care how far
I never wanted to live (Live) forever
Now you are the pressure holding me together
(To erase me forever)
You let the blackout take me
You have to go to erase me
I never wanted to live forever
But I blacked out all my memories
Crawl into my heart and they keep it cold
Right to where you are
(To erase mе)
A fall from grace
I'll always remember what you did
I walk with the dead but I feel the souls
Let me take the fall for another ghost
Abandoned me, left all on my own again
Well, you can fucking try
(To erase me)
Drive in all the nails when the coffins close
