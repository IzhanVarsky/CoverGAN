When it’s dark it’s easier to see
Did you get what you needed?
Gave you an inch and you took a mile
I couldn’t see that I was lost
We are the misled generation
We know the truth but you’re in denial
You took everything we believed in
Hard not to walk away and put it all to bed
I’m talking to ghosts and they don’t know what they have
Hard not to walk away and put it all to rest
I’m talking to ghosts but I’m still speaking too fast
Wouldn’t you like to know if they’re talking to me back?
And I spent to long finding where I belong
We are the glasshearts
The light to lead us through this misery
Wouldn’t you like to know if I’ll be taking it back?
When no one ever seems to care or seems to give a shit
Go back on what you say and be a hypocrite
