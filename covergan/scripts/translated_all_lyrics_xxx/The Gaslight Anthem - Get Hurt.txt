And maybe I was mine and maybe you were not the same
Once I could tell all the hurt apart from myself
And it gets pretty late and the stations will change
I think I'm gonna move to California
(Say a prayer for me)
(All my friends get so low-down)
Sometimes I dream some more
I think I came to find the feeling, baby
I heard they never bleed
Momma, can you say a prayer for me?
And maybe you needed a change or maybe I was in the way
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
Now all I can see is the need, the need
I heard they don't get so low-down
Between what was mine and what was yours
Spent my nights in dislocation
(I think it's time to move)
And I came to get hurt
Talking to spirits on the floor
Maybe some things they stay and some things go away
Have you come here to get her?
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me
Baby, as I come stumblin' through the door
Not like we bleed
I keep my wounds without a bandage
Might as well do your worst to me, yeah
Have you come to take her away from me?
And the things once in order now seem so strange
