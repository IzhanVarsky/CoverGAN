Yeah, and the beat goes on
Today I woke up to a brand new me
Can I be myself ever again?
The sights and sounds, the rise and the fall
Foundations that could never break
So how many times must I beat my head against a wall
What happened to my happy ending?
I'll find my way after all
I don't have it in me to sing of defeat
It's time I put you six feet deep underground
It's time to put you six feet deep underground
Was moving forward a mistake?
And I'm ready for what tomorrow brings
Because more was said in silence
The beat goes on
What happened to my happy ending?)
Before I finally break through?
Than I could ever say in this song
I know I can't rewrite history
I will not stay silent ever again
(How many times)
Triumph over tragedy
And I'm heading nowhere fast
But the beat goes on
Or is that me pretending?
For all the demons that follow me around
So how many times
This is where it ends
Yesterday is gone
Is this where it ends?
(Foundations that could never break
Running around in circles
It all played out with my life on pause
