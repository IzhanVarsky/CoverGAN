Or you'll be damned
They get by by the grace of god
They're naive
When they recieve it
And the glamour
You'll land it
And the haze
Fall from grace
Through the darkness
Say your prayers
Hands shake and heads will nod
If they demand it
Cut by the chisel
Hey boy
We get by, we get by, by the grace of God
And destroyer
Yeah, they get by, by the grace of God
A straight and narrow
They will act like dogs
Hey girl
So they'll believe it
And beat by the hammer
They lust with cheeks unturned
You've got the looks
You understand
Bystander
He's a watcher
They need - they yearn
And a voyer
You've got supplies
Yeah, they get by
