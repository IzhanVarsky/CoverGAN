You can hit me on my line
Tell me why, baby, you're so
Have I ever made you smile?
When I come off too strong
I look kinda crazy
Well, let me know
If there's something wrong
Any time
Back when it was only you and me
Ooh-ooh!
Oh
Oh, please don't get me wrong
Have I ever turned you on?
Oh, baby, you're so
And girl, if it feels right
Heavy hearted, like we used to be
And I need to know
Any day or night
Did I play or did I tease?
'Cause I love you so
'Cause I, 'cause I love you so
Now we're apart
Have I set your mind at ease?
Oh, for even just a while
Oh, let me know
Have I ever done you wrong?
Oh, no
'Cause now we're apart
