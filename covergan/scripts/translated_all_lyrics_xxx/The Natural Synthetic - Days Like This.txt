To take the cuffs off of my wrist
Maybe we're better off
I knew it but I took the risk
Sleep deprived, and I've been running
I've been watching, the sunrise and fighting
When i don't have a reason
And now we're stuck in the grieving
Now you saying we shouldn't talk
I know it's late and I shouldn't call
On the edge of the precipice
There would be days like, days like
And maybe I won't dream of you
Days like, days like this
There was a storm that we couldn't stop
But I don't wanna believe it
Just wanna know what you're thinking
I knew there would be days like this
Take the cuffs off of my wrist
Oh I knew there would be days like this
There would be days like, days like this
Never let it catch me
