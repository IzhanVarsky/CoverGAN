A misanthropic anthropoid with nothing to
Break all the fucking rules and
Hey do what you want, but don't do it around me
Go to Hell with Superman and
Hey I don't know if the billions will survive
My moniker is man and I'm rotten to the core
But I'll believe in God when one and one are five
Idleness and dissipation breed apathy
Die like a champion, yeah hey!
I sit on my ass all goddamn day
I'll tear down the building just to pass through the door
Say what you must, do all you can
