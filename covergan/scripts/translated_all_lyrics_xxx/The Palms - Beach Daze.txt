Remember how a song
But I'm only human
Taking my own
I'm in love with a shade of grey
I'm struggling to believe
And no one's right
Beach daze
When it really shouldn't matter to me
Baby tonight
Now the crowds are gone
Baby that's all I want
To watch it wash away
Well I'm just a fool
That's all I want
Would you spend it on things that don't make you happy?
You know it's just a phase
And it'd take you to another place
Build my castle back up
Now I'm turning my time into gold
Imagine time as a currency
And it's there for all my friends to see
Beach daze on weekdays
Floating into outer space
If we're gonna fall out
But the voices say
When it used to come on
You make the difference
There'll be better days
In this moment realize
Know forever there'll be
Got my sleeves rolled up
Oh happiness
Won't you come my way
I just want to say
If only, they told me
