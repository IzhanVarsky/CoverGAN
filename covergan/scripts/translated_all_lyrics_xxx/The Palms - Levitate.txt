We're gonna celebrate
So watch me as I levitate
Better go an' tell 'em
We don't discriminate
Woke up Sunday morning with a song stuck in my head
We almost had it all
(We're going past the stars)
Gonna celebrate
(Let's take this way too far)
And "give it up" was the best thing that they said
Once again, all bets say, they won't make it
All these thing that they told me, used to mold me
Some day we'll have this thing figured out
(We'll take you past the stars)
(No matter who you are)
One shot and I'm holdin', but I don't care 'cuz I'm golden
'Til then, better go an' tell 'em
So watch me here as I levitate
Stretched out in the centerfold that I can't get out of my head
Seein' things right before me
o'clock in the mornin'
Under the moonlight, another moment
We're going straight to the stars 'cuz that's who we are
Used to own me, but that's the old me
But that's the old me
