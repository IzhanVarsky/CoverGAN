I was just a lost soul, I needed a guide
You've refilled my heart up from the ground
Turn my world around!
Coz' you and I know that
(Looking back together, yeah)
And the moment that you came to change my life
Fears I had
Oh yeah, yeah
Feel alive
I know I was walking around in disguise
Oh, you fired up my heart and made me smile
Turn my world around, world around
Like a little piece of heaven finally found
Looking back
Turn my world around
It's a fact
Oooooh yeah
(Oh yeah, yeah)
All fading away by a minute and I
(I'm-I'm-I'm)
I'm a different person, yeah
(Turn my world around)
And you and I know baby!
You have twisted all of my troubles inside
Coz' you and I know, baby
