Shattered I resign
One and what you are
For lovers built the dream
Stare down your masters
(We're on the verge)
(Where you've wrought, where you've wrought)
(What you are, what you are, we're on the verge)
Returning, returning a kiss
Fractured as this wish
We're on the verge, we're on the verge
Did the times, wind
'Midst the chaff, as meek
Say, I done told you
Say, dire warning
Did the crowd, kind
From creation's crown
Shadows hold the mist
Of sacred dawning and sloe-sloe eyes
Aping youth, wise
Ever lost, ides
And those weak, as sand
With the promise of (With the promise of)
For the hours should they pass
We're on the verge
Turning glass upside down
Where you've wrought
Say how I tried too
With the promise of (With the promise of )
Tangеnts vex the whorl
The void arrivеs then leaves
Fragments form the mind
