Now...
How is this make you feeling?
I got a secret and I gotta fucking tell somebody
I'm burning up about it, come and step inside it with me
Would you tell it now?
Feel...
I play the victim, get defensive just rememberin' it
Would you tell it... now?
Your heart can’t take it?
Your heart can't take it?
What if it makes you feel more alone than
I got a secret but the way it makes me feel...
The more I think about it, I can't even vouch for me
You've ever felt in your life?
What if it hurts you and it's so bad
You’ve ever felt in your life?
I’m burning up about the way it makes me feel...
I got a secret, gotta tell someone, come share it with me
I got a secret, gotta do something, come share it with me
I can't keep it all locked up inside of me
And would you tell it now?
I never heard it, so I thought my mind was playing again
It’s like the secret's seeping through my defense coming to me
I got a secret, come and take a look inside it with me
