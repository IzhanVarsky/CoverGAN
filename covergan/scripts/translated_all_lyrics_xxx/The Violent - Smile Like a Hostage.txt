And smile like a hostage
Only thinking of yourself
With your loyal believers
So we'll just smile and say
So are you sticking out?
We love to watch you
Dependent on your skills
Fail your own game
Staking your claim
You're too much
You patronize yourself
You'd better make amends
Speaking too loud could cast you to the wolves
I've done so much and think of only you
To the bee than the cattle
Thanks so much
We hate to watch you
So smile like a hostage
Behind the glass in the shadows
See you through the key
As to better suit you
Trying to suit you
The sting is more intense
Enemies and alliеs made
And your words never matter
Be careful of thе ones who are unsure
I'd like to take this time to thank you all
Now we're throwing stones
