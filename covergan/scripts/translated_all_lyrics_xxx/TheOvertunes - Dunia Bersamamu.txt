I'm happy to hear your laughter light up my heart
What is there for you
I will continue to survive
This is my world
Yourself
And even though time is running
Only you complete me
Myself
You are the most beautiful in my life
To be with you
You are my breath
I want to know the meaning of my life
My hug that will always warm you
My hug will always take care of you
This feeling only exists when you are with you
Your tears weaken my heart
And no one can take you away from me
I want to be beside you all my life
Hold my hand lean on me
