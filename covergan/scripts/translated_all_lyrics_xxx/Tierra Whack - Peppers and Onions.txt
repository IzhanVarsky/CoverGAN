Make a phone call home to the ones I love (Love)
To be real, man, I thought about pullin' the plug (Uh)
Paparazzi takin' pictures like I'm in a cage, nigga (Woo)
To combine my thoughts and never deny my health (Uh)
But often times I gotta remind myself
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn)
You got to be the one that people lookin' up to (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, you can have the tick, it might not be your time (Yeah)
So forgive me if I get this wrong (Yeah)
But I had to slow it down, 'cause I ain't no grave digger (Ching, ching, ching, ching)
I'm not perfect, just a person (Yeah, yeah)
White folks yellin', "Yo, that's a brave nigga!"
I'm new to this game, I ain't been here long (Long)
I get lost sometimes, Italy, I roam (Yeah)
I tried to reach the Sun, but gum is stuck to my shoes (I try, I try, I try, yeah, yeah)
I had to figure certain things out on my own (Woo)
I'm only human, yeah
A whole lot richer and a whole lot quicker
Yeah (Damn)
The pros and the cons of bein' the bomb
So I can go fly high with the ones above (Ooh)
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous (Yeah, yeah)
Even though we buy chains, we just wanna be free (Damn, damn, damn)
Peppers and the onions
We just wanna be free (Damn)
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna be me (Damn, damn, damn)
Shit crazy out here, have you high on drugs? (Damn)
