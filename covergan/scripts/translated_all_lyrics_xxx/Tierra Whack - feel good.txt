Whack, why you always be so bold?
Fake smiles never had me sold
It goes happy this, it goes happy that
Even in the summer, my heart cold
Holidays just keep gettin' old
I done seen the stars, I done seen the lights
But somehow I can't seem to find happy Whack
(Where did she go?)
(Holidays just keep gettin' old)
But I can't forget that I'm still hood
All I really want is to be happy and truly feel good
Just me and not you, don't want you around
Who can I look up to when I'm feelin' down?
I got everybody lookin' at me like, "Why she don't feel good?"
Why would I lie and say I feel good, when I don't feel good?
