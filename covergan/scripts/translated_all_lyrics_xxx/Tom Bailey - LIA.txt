With each day that passes on by
Fine for making love
And this time said I sure don't wanna miss it (miss it, miss it)
I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching baby
Summertime and the weather is fine
Oh Lia Lia really wanna get to know you Lia (ooh)
Lia Lia oh Lia Lia
About you, you and I
Been a while since I felt something like this (like, like this)
Little sugar givе it to me (Lia, Lia)
[Verse }
Come on pretty sugar take my hand
Ooh Lia Lia, oh Lia when I see ya
I got to say I really love what you do
I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching
And all the things we could be doing
Lia Lia oh Lia oh Lia
And I wonder maybe you already got a man (ooh)
Oh Lia really wanna squeeze ya
Said I wanna get lost in it, ooh yеah yeah (Lia, Lia)
Said I wanna get lost in it (Lia, Lia)
Oh you're sweet so sweet, ooh yeah yeah yeah (Lia, Lia)
Said I just got to have it (Lia, Lia)
Cuz I want you said I need you to understand
So do you mind if I talk to you for a minute
Oh I've been dreaming
Said I just wanna be your man
