Top-down with the cruise control
Lights out with the radio on
Mr. Dayes with the break of the drums
High beam, on the dash
This is where we go
Rapper of the year, fuck the nominees
Niggas put real diamonds in fake ass Rollies, that's clown shit
Can't do it alone
Yeah, Freddie Kane clocking overseas
They can’t understand it, this gangster shit run a panic
Every whip, I wish it was either German-made or Italian
And when the Nightrider comes around
Them pounds in, these niggas window shoppers, they browsin’
Yeah, yeah, should I bless the track or let it breathe?
Yeah, trap shit round you, sent your bitch on a round trip
Put that on VL, I put VVs in my medallion
I began and even when I was down and out, I was wild
I got a feeling that won't come down
I be shaking you down, it's a wrap
You can’t take it slow
I ride low with the setting sun
Harley, Corvette
Super dope, my geekers smoke media, Robert Townsend
Yeah, I need Salah, forgot to hit my knees
I'll take you to the fat of the land
You gotta pick up the dough
I be shaking you down, it’s a wrap
I was wild, I just blessed the track, so let it breathe
It's crazy
I be chasing you down, it's a wrap
Freddie Kane clocking overseas
Yeah, ice minus four degrees, put a ho at ease
Don't listen to what they say
It's icy (cold)
So easily, so easily
