(Ooooooooo)
In the corner of your eye
Hey
What kinda music
Opened up a door
(fieuw)
Your words follow me home
You go the way I go
And I came back for more
Can I make it clear
There's nothing to see here
It's too late to look back
I was hidden amongst the crowd
I'm a stranger you recognise
I know that my mind will keep me down
Take another look around
Forever got this tag on me
The demons come and go
I know that with time they come around
I didn't make a sound
