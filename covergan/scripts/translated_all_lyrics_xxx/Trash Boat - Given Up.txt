I don't know what to take
I'm suffocating
Looking for help somehow somewhere
Put me out of myâ€”
Another day's been laid to waste
And no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me?
Take this all away
In my disgrace
I'm not prepared
I've given up
Put me out of my misery
I hyperventilate
I'm sick of feeling
Put me out of my fucking misery
Is there nothing you can say?
Thought I was focused but I'm scared
Stuck in my head again
There's no escape
Wake in a sweat again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
God!
