Maybe we will be happy where we are
Everything I dreamed of is knocking at my door
I can't find a reason, but I still want more
Focused on tomorrow, but today's still here
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And will we ever see without comparing scars?
Am I too selfish? Am I too wrapped up in my head?
Just breathe, just be
Will we ever be happy where we are?
'Cause nothing is working, oh, nothing
Happy where we are
Smoking all my problems, thinking they'd disappear
But they keep burning, all these questions in my head
