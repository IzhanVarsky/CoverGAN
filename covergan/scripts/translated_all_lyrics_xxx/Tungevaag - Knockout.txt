We are, burning the house down
K.O, K.O, straight for the knockout
Can't stop, no turning back now
Make some mistakes
No matter what, we'll be fine
Yeah, we'll be fine, let's
No heels, just feels
Lights out, final round
Crossing lines, and wasting time
Now that we're raising the stakes
We're cool as ice, yeah
Think of the, things we could do
I'm in, are you?
You know we won't think twice
'Til the, morning, you and I
I say, let's stay, out tonight
Going in, living, the dream
Follow the Ruby eyes, and Champagne smiles, yeah
