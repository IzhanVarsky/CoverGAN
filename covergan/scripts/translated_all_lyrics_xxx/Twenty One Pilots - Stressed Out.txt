Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
We're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
