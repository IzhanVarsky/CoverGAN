Leave you colder
Over my shoulder
I just need your trust to get me through, yeah
I won't come back from
There's why you look
Already had enough of you
It's unlike you
It's unlike you, my love
And that's why I got no weight on my shoulder
(Look over my shoulder)
There’s why you look
'Cause I could give you
Every day
She coming at me like the stonemen
But you ain't done enough for me, my love
Anything you want
On my shoulder
’Cause you know I can't always be my best
Is away
I never meant to put you to this test, oh yeah
She digging hole so I could fall in
And that’s why your love
Looking anymore
It’s unlike you, my love
All I need is a little more from you
But is it worth it for you?
'Cause I know that I never did trust you
And that's why your love
Just what I want girl really ain't worth debating
