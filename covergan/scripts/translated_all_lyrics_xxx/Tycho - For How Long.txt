Somethin' to show me where the hope is
I've been waitin' for it so long, so long
For how long?
Tell me, how long?
No? That's okay, that's cool
You're sayin' that you love me? Yeah
You don't like to share, I do
But for how long? Yeah
You keep on sayin' that you love me
Can't you see the way I do?
Oh, I love and care for a lot of you
I love you, baby, but I'm so gone, so gone
Oh, I love and care for more than one of you
You keep tellin' me to hold on, hold on
So gone, yeah
How long? I keep waitin' for you
Hold on, yeah
So long, yeah
I keep waiting on a moment
