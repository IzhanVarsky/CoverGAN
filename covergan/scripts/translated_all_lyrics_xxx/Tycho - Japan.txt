For me to come home
At all
Hey, yeah
Came home from Japan
You got me spinning round for you
Oh, I’m on a roll
This a touch and go
To tell you the truth
I’m gonna break her down
I'm bad, but I'm good
Steady as she goes
She don't mind
So you can't say I didn’t warn you
But don’t wait
I don't know how it happened
I won’t make
I'll be so good to you
She don’t mind at all
On your own when you landed
Don't know how it happened
She don’t mind
