Hey, yeah
Don't complicate it, complicate it
No conversation, no conversation
Come down now
I'm serious, I like to keep it a little less serious
Get yourself off the ground
Am I too good for love?
Oh, we're flyin' now, not gonna let you down
Won't be too good for love
Come down now, come down now, yeah
Dangerous, I like to keep it a little bit dangerous
Roll down the window
Yeah, hey, yeah
Oh, feel the breeze now
Yeah, we could skate all day and all night long
No, I won't save you but I'll show you how
Come down now, come down now
Oh, baby, breathe now
Not gonna let you down
