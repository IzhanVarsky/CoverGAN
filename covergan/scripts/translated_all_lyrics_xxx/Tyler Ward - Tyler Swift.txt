I'll be right there backstage if you need anything
The girl who wrote "Fifteen"
Could this really be?
My hands are shakin'
So I stroll on by like the summer breeze
Noticed she was poppin' to a T-Pain beat
So I roll the dice, no more time I'm wastin'
Talking 'bout why you had to let him go
Your long blonde hair girl heaven flow
Would you mind if I stopped in and told you 'hi'?
Baby, just say yes
She wore a little black dress in the middle of spring
I saw you in a video
I'll even promise you this
The prettiest scene is you just marryin' me
That pretty long blonde hair girl gone and caught my eye
And 'hi' my name is Taylor, nice to meet you, how's your night been goin'?
For thirteen minutes I was heaven sent
Am I mistaken?
Call me Tyler Swift
Last night's dream that's how it went
Like the firework flash on the fourth of July
I say 'hi, my name is Tyler, nice to meet you, how's your day been goin'?
And yes I could see ya in my future
Just Taylor and Tyler Swift
And I, I can see her in my future, writing songs together
I'm sitting outside on the front porch swing
You belong with me
And I was noddin' my head right there sayin' this ain't fair
'Cause that's when I think happiness
Just for that one shot at a meet and greet
The way you wear that little black dress
I won a contest at the radio station
Or the sunset fallin' from the summer sky
I'll change my name to Swift
I meet you at the Denver show
I finally get to meet
'Cause I first saw you in a video
Then I fell right back down to my reality
I even promise you this
