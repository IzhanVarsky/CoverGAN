Lying in bed
Deeper, deeper, comfort the ground
Waiting for you to come and knock on my door
Trying to escape the thoughts in my head
Too late to find a way home?
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper
Broken bottles on the bedroom floor
I can't live without your love
Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
Too late for apologies?
Why are we drifting apart?
Deeper, deeper, it's pulling us down
Again and again and again
Too late to fund a way home?
I'm missing your touch
Woah Dum dum dum da da da da da da dum
This is too much
(Deeper, deeper)
Sleepless nights, no love, no more
Throw me a lifeline
Is it too late for love?
I'm paralysed
You pull me in so you can shut me out
