How many days do you need to sober up? Yeah
Something about you seems so magical
The house has always been here
Why do I keep going if I'm absent
When I don't run from anybody else? Why?
How many times do I need to say that?
Oh, so overwhelming
Oh, forget about everything you heard
Always and forever grateful (Always and forever grateful)
Just know I will be loving you always, always
Always and forever grateful
Oh, I need you now more than you know
All these questions never ending
I have to think twice right before I speak, yeah
I cannot lie when I look into your eyes, your eyes
How many ways can you say it so?
So plant the seed and let it grow, always
