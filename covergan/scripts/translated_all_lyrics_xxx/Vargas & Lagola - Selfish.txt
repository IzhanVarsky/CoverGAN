Yeah, you got soaked, intentions are good
We sink and we swim, we lose and we win
I can feel the thunder and the lightning from within me
Maybe it's a no return, but you're always on my mind
Hey, I've been too proud to let it go (What'd you say?)
We don't need to leave now, we can stay here forever
Take a little something for your heartache, for the better
Hey, I've been too proud to let it go
'Cause I'm not afraid anymore
I've been too stupid to let you know that
I didn't believe in magic before you
Go ahead and call me selfish for holding onto my love
It doesn't matter who is wrong or right
But go ahead and call me selfish, but I didn't give you up
Am I too emotional, irresponsible to be carefree? Ooh
You don't have to justify your sins
Don't care if they never notice
I feel we've been here before, yeah
