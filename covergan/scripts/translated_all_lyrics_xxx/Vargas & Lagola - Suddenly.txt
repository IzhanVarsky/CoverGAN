Suddenly I feel weightless now
Up and down and round and round a roller coaster
Easy to be wise after a good night's sleeping
Never leave your side until the war is over
Suddenly I feel changes now
Wonder why we never stop, we're always searching
Suddenly
I do my best to try to use a little patience
Babe, I know the signs of freedom when I see 'em, see 'em
Suddenly I feel chainless
Listen to our records singing picture perfect
'Cause I know the sound of a heart when it's breaking, breaking
Suddenly I feel painless now
Oh dear mama, little did I know
Smiling when you're telling me it's always worth it, worth it
But I never found a reason to be waiting
Babe, you say the world is heavy on your shoulders, shoulders
Using all your powers never count as cheating
