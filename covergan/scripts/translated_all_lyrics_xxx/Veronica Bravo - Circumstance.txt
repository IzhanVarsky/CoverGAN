Some just always get their way
Things been out of place
Even weeks
Not our fault
It’s everybody else
To let it go
Up in the clouds
We been holding out for days
Don’t worry, don’t worry
All we need is space
When will it be?
Baby I understand
It’s just the circumstance
We’ll focus on the good somehow
You’re flying like kings now
But I won’t leave
Everyone’s too loud
Don’t say you’re sorry no
And now we’re gold
Can’t hear us though
Don’t worry
I love ya, I love ya
If it’s not today
And try and get some sleep
It’s getting old yeah
Am I misconceived?
Are you here to stay?
We’ve ironed all the kinks out
Cause they all got their heads down
We got too much going on
I believe
Permanently
We just talked it out
I’ll paint over that frown
We should go to bed now
And we’ve been losing sleep
It’s all good, it’s all good
So we can move on
Don’t worry it’s all good now
Don’t worry I won’t leave now
