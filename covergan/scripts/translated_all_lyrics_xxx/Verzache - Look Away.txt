It's tough out in the cold
The internet is fucking me
These thoughts still moshing
I order on my phone
'Member what it did for me
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And they send it to my home
I'm just screamin' like
'Kay, well everything's a part of me
I'm just screaming like-
Hope they don't make me a clone
Nothing on its own
Heart pumping, still don’t wanna pass away
Wha-What was it something that I said?
Yeah, oh, yeah
I kick it all alone
Same words, different tone
Ah, oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
But I can’t stand living like this up in any way
Weekdays I just let em run away
Got used to dealing with your pretty little lies
Just cool it, only got a matter of time
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Its not my problem
And I cannot feel my face
I wanna charge, they watch for free
Ah, oh, ah, oh
And I felt it better than I ever did in my life (On that night)
And I never used ya, didn't see a warning sign
Shouldn’t spend no time guessing what you’re gonna say
And this love is just a loan
Why'd you look away?
Will do it, well, probably
I'm feeling super great
Don't need no apology
The pop culture, the jewelry
What you want then?
Want me to sweep you off your feet
