Shine a light towards you like this
in my heart
My heart is full of excitement in this moment
all your wishes come true
Promise me, this moment is forever, just like this
show me your heart
Light footsteps fly with the wind
call my name alright
Now just stay by my side
to another world
shine on you in the dark
I will do it I will do it
Tell me, tell me everything, your heart
Now only good things like this
As you wish
I'll show you everything whenever, whatever
Come on, our own world (I will make it)
I will close my eyes and show you (I will make it happen)
Little by little it gets dyed and overflows
I will do it I will do it (oh, oh!)
I will always go see you oh
as you wish
On this beautiful night that counts the stars
Hold my hand without being shaken by the harsh wind
tell me i'll listen
everything will come true
look at me like now
Trust me, fly over that sky
Everything you wanted
In the dark night I'll find the light
tell me what you want
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Don't hesitate any longer, never
throw you into another world
take me out
as the feeling comes
I will smoke you
as I dreamed
Yul-i-la-yuri-la-yuri-ya
I will only be by your side like this
May we never change
made obliviate
never come again
We will always be together oh
Feel me, we want, we want, love ya
I'll listen to everything whenever, whatever
achieve bomb la-ta la-ta
A day with a good feeling for some reason (It’s sweet, it’s a different feeling)
I will do it I will do it (oh oh oh oh)
