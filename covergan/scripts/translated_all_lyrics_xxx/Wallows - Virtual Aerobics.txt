Being here for the first time with you
Work hard no matter what happens next
Yeah, you made me blush like that (Like that)
Tell me when you think they've had enough
There's no color in San Francisco
Let’s spend the night
I'll clean ’em off when they get a scuff
It lets me see it totally new
I love how you move like that
I'll probably overwear these Nikes
Read it, I unravel
Kill me, let's spend the night
Wanna dress in what makes you like me
You laughed and said, "Just look around you"
I’m not too good, but I try my best
Hey, watch my grapevine and my sidekick
Yeah, you called me out like that (Like that)
Simple words that might
We could live a life like that (Like that)
Side like that, side like, side like
I'll get to your side like that
Only been here one night, leavin' doesn't feel right
Doing some virtual aerobics
I’ll clean 'em off when they get a scuff
Hey there, safe travels
When we aren't together, fuck all of the weather
I love how you kiss like
