White wings
In wide winds
Follow me
Lend me a feather
Wings white
In all my time?
White raven
Duld and dwelling lands
Gave me sion
With the song seida
(Which tempts me)
Gave me the song
As you tempt
Give me vision
Look in the shade
Do you want to follow me?
Gave me wings
Let's fly
Gygrefuggel
White frame
As you find
Out in the foam
(As I find)
I hear you ask!
Teach me the song
Then I will ache
Entices me
Let me divorce
Magic crow
Do you want to protect me?
