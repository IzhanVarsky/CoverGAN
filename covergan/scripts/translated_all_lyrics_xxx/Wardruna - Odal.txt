With newly sprouted buds
Host me higher and deeper
Heavily it weighs
Kvedar
We are an old tree
entrance abandoned
Far down in the mess
Hugs at all
If you want
The night it comes
Right!
Odal
Look deep into me
and in rings of years
It does not leave
Day cracking
They testify of honor
eyes blue
When storms go
Forward to grow
Goodbye old
In the bark its wound
Some sting more than others
Hugs, take no more
you have to understand
I'll give you your share
Towards the sun we stretched
They testify of nid
Give root you direction
than you can bear to pray
Deep in the ground
For every single sprout
