Silver spoon
Talk big
You cannot fool me
Walk bold
Touch machine
Take a picture in your red g
Ah, there goes the pulse queen
For soil
No tone
See the stains in your gold teeth
With a taste
You cannot school me
Ahh! There goes the pulse queen
Such a waste
With no money
Don't forget another selfie
Hey newcomer
Hey fool
So inviting
Hey pretender
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake scene
Yeah I'll pass up on your fake
Talk cheap
Of foil
