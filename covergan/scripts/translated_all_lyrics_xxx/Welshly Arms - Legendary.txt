You gotta live without a compromise
To make a stand, you've got to win the fight
A new answer to the same question
To fight this world of ill intentions
Fighting tooth and nail on the way up
Yeah
'Cause we're gonna be legends (Legends)
Gonna get their attention (Ooh)
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson (Ooh)
And we couldn't want it anymore
Eventually, they're gonna know who's right
Been dreaming of the payoff
Can't stand the heat, then just stay out the light
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Ooh)
What we're doing here ain't just scary
Taking pages from a magazine
(Legends) Oh, oh
Through the struggles and the trade-offs
Ever since we were seventeen
'Cause we're gonna be legends (Ooh)
We could never turn back now
This is what we came for
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
Gonna get their attention (Attention)
(Legends) Ooh, legends
Got to leave it all on the floor
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson (Lesson)
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Legends)
Take a look around me
And on, and on, and on
It's about to be legendary
How many times will you learn the same lesson?
For you might never make it out alive
I think they got it all wrong
We just gotta hold on
You know the truth can be a weapon
Tell them the truth, but they think it's just made up
Let everybody hear your battle cry
Been looking for the answers
And I think they got it all wrong
