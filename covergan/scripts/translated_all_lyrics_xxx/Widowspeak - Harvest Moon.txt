We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising
I want to celebrate
When we were lovers
See it shining in your eye
On this harvest moon
Let's go out and feel the night
I watched you from afar
But now it's getting late
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Just like children sleeping
And the moon is climbing high
When we were strangers
I loved you with all my heart
Hear what I have to say
Come a little bit closer
