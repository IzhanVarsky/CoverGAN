No one is old, and nothing is young
Where the softness used to be
It won't go back to being green again
You're a peach and
Try to hold on to the sweet
Feeling less then revealing more
I was there, but wasn't mine
I'm a plum
You were in bloom in your own time
I feel nothing
No one is old, and nothing is, nothing is young
You're a peach, you're a peach and I'm a plum
Feel the bruising through the skin
I feel dumb
The stone that's buried: what the fruit is for
You're a peach and I'm a plum
