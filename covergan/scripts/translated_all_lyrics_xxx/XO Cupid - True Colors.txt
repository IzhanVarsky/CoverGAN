Don't be, don't be afraid
In a world, full of people
Oh, I realize. it's hard to take courage
Like a rainbow
If this world makes you crazy
You can lose sight of it all
Don't be, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Your true colors, true colors, true colors are beautiful
Don't be discouraged
But I see your true colors, shining through
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
And the darkness inside you can make you feel so small
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
You with the sad eyes
You call me up, 'cause you know i'll be there
And You've taken all you can back
Show me a smile and don't be unhappy
