Over and done with love
No one knows about you don't mean that I don't trust you
You probably really don't need my help
I'm infatuated, yeah
Need your lovin', I put no one up above ya
But we all need somebody to love
I know you getting tired of Versace and the loafers
If you don't like you a secret I keep you so undercover tho
I love you with a passion, yeah
You had a taste of love
Livin' pages of the past movin' forward different story, yah-yah
We all need somebody
You said you're over and done
I know that you can do it all by yourself
Girl, I'm locked in, don't know why you asking now
Pain in your eyes that the cash can't heal
'Cause you had a hole in your heart that the bags can't fill
Girl you got my heart and can't nobody take it from you
Wake up every day waiting for it to be over
Yeah the taste of love but he fucked up and now you're numb
Take you everywhere you want to go and not your money
Different chapter, yeah
Twitching on my faction, yeah
You got every pair but need somebody that could hold ya
Treat you like my music
But he fucked up and now you're numb
Got me so distracted, yeah-yeah
