Already beside you
I'm on
The day I met
Thank you
With a smile like that day
Nevertheless
I'm connected to you now
With my joy
That's how I grow up
May I be with you forever
Your smile you will never forget
Memories come back
Come up
Ale to send
In everyday life, not just fun
I remember
Walk forward
My feelings are just
A lot of love is overflowing
So now
To you who look lonely
Living gap
See the tears shed
forever and ever
Where no one can see
Every day
We are working hard
Being by your side
With happiness
Found me
Even in a remote city
You see, I'm so happy
The spring of joy
In uneasy days alone
Please don't cry
I'm happy
Memories overflow
Departure season
Your importance is happiness
Your joy
Hard things
Such a thing that can be shared
If you look back, there are many
Your tears overflowing
If you look back, you can't count
Hey you
Dandruff prayer
It leads to a lot of love
You took me out
Rescue me
I love you
visited
By itself
Kiseki who always walked with you
I can't go back to anyone
