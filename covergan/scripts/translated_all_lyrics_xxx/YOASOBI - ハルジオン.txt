Unknowingly
What was projected is the future trapped in the buds
The scenery that revives vividly and the fragments of everyday life that cannot be returned
I should have been able to see
Two people reflected on the screen looking melancholy
I was pretending not to see the reality
I nodded and believed in your words
In the passing time
Connecting the future that should have been lost
To the future that has certainly begun to move
I'm walking through the continuation of the days I can't go back
Bloomed beyond the border
From now on, even without you
The future also slipped through the gaps between my fingers
There is just no beauty
I can't see it, I can't see it
I told you I like you
The feelings she hid with this hand without showing it to anyone
Ah-ah
Your sign
Was laughing
Even though I could actually see the bright flowers
Time passes to leave alone
The feeling that the scenery we spent together was forgotten
With daily fragments that cannot be returned
Still I just want to see you again
Still reaching for the two of that day
Remember you
I'm still looking for it
If you wave to the two of you that day
Only I was left
I drew the border myself
I'm still alive in me If you close your eyes
To know too much that you don't want to know
I locked the door of my worn-out heart
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
The back of my eyes was soaked in the sky that was too blue
I'm going back to the scenery of that day
I was swallowed by the days that just passed
With your words and beautiful time of that day
