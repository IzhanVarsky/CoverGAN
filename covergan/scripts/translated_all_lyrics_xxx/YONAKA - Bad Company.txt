'Cause I'm trying to scream, it feels like a dream
'Cause I was fine before you came to my door
I've been lying in my bed, but I haven't slept a wink
(Got bad company)
So tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Mother, can you help me?
This can't keep going on
No sound comes out, no one's to be seen
'Cause I know that it's not, I know that it's not
So I guess I got bad company
But I know I'm not alone
Because I am you
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
Now it's my blood you see
Said, "I don't know," but he won't leave
I got a picture in my head, but it's not what I like to see
Why have you come for me? (Why have you come for me?)
So tell me what you want, tell me want you want
Is this just fun for you? (Is this just fun for you?)
And then this big black cloud came down to smother me
So I guess I got bad company?
But I won't react 'cause I'll look psycho
Oh, what does he want from me?
I've been locked up, can't escape it
When I try to close my eyes, yeah, my mind, it just overthinks
And you talk to me with your violent tongue
I go out of my mind, thinking 'bout what I used to be
I was left with no choice but to care about company
Yeah, I know I'm not alone
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
No, this can't keep going on
Why do I feel like I'm suffocating?
