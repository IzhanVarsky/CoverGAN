Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
If you need me at all
'Cause I'm crying out your pain
I'm trying hard to get through
I know that I'm not perfect
I'll be there when you fall
I will help you through this mess
I will always pick up the phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't wait 'til tomorrow)
I will always pick up my phone
I'll be at your side when you've had enough
I'm sick and tired of you thinking it's unfair
If you're lonely you can call me, don't you know?
Oh-oh, oh
I'll be right here for you
It's all love, Heaven's above
I'm gonna help you climb that mountain
Just know I'll be there, remember that I care
I'm just caught up in it
Oh-oh
To call me up and come my way
I'm screaming down your walls
When you're drowning, I'm gonna dive in
We were young and were best friends
It doesn't matter where you are up in this world
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
But if God gave me this much
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Though it seems that I don't really care
Can you hear me at all?
It could never be too late
I would love to see your face
We could take it back to when
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whenever you need me just reach out and call my name
When you put yourself there
I'll be there to fix you
