Caught in the mirror, can't recognise your face
Too many photos and not enough friends
Where the party's gonna go
Suited and booted, but got no money
Come on baby, let's play!
And it's all I seem to see
Get out my way, I'm sick of being polite
I thought I'd have it worked out and I'd be making plenty
Tryna' act a grownup, now that's pretty funny
Waiting on the next fad on the next trend
I'm feeling pretty empty, this attitudes expensive
Oooh, oooh
Put down your small-talk and teach me to fight
Take a trip and you might find...
Can't you see you're on your own?
Walk into the room, everybody looks the same
Oooh, ooh oooh
Doesn't like the way that this curse leaves my lips
Fuck what you think, I'm not trying to impress you
Posers in the hall and they clogging up the stairways
Working on their bitch face
And the party's over now
And it's all you seem to know
Bet you're itching to find out
So you turn up at my door
I'm so tired of this place, yeah
Small town baby, got his knickers in a twist
Let's make this public, let's take it outside
I'll probably just upset you, you're tryna' be your best you
Let's make this personal, stop wasting my time
Trying too hard, yeah it's gonna make you age
But you don't know anyone
Why you scared of change, yeah?
