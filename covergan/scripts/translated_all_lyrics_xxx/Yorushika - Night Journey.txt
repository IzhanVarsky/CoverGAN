You don't know yet, but the sky is also made of words
Lyrics of Yorushika "Night Journey"
Haruru Hara-kun's song and one-wheeled grass
I don't need any words
Do you want to take the train? I wonder where I am
Well, I'll get there at the end of the road
Summer is over
Flower breeze, swaying and single-flowered grass
Smooth, smooth
Well, if it's a neighboring town, I'll get there
I see
I'm going over there all the time
Is there anything you want to do? I wonder if i want to see it
Harara, Harara, Harari
Yeah, I'm an adult
Rippling Natsuhara, crying without tears, Higurashi is evening, evening, evening
I'll stay here
Natsuhara, who stands up, with his hair still, crying and raining evening, evening, evening
Hey, what would happen to us if the night came like this?
I don't need anything else
You will forget, but only the memories are true
Hey, what will happen to us when we grow up someday?
