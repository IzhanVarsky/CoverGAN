Before your soul hits the ground
You can offer them a cocktail, but what's the sense in turning back?
Treat yourself
Throw yourself a dinner party
Set the table, place flowers 'round the room
Throw yourself
Out the window you can hear the people laugh
Know yourself
Don't waste your life waiting 'round
Light the candles and don't pour the drinks too soon
You spend your life waiting 'round
