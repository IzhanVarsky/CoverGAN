Players only love you when they're playing
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and
And what you lost
And what you had
Have you any dream you'd like to sell?
Say, women, they will come and they will go
Thunder only happens when it rains
Well, who am I to keep you down?
Of your loneliness
Thunder only happens when it's raining
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Dreams of loneliness
But listen carefully to the sound
Now here I go again I see the crystal visions
Like a heartbeat drives you made in the stillness of remembering what you had
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
