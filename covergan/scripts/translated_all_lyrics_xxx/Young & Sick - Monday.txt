In love with you
It took me thirty-two years to believe in me
There's always something to live and die for
My head may hurt, but my heart doesn't ache for once
And the only thing blue are the dreamy skies of New York
Aah, aah
It's been a while since I felt this naked
But there's comfort in knowing I'm not alone
Ooh
It's Monday and I'm in love
But for now, it's Monday and I'm in love, oo!
And it'll be another ten to love myself, oo!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I wish I liked myself better naked
Ooh, ooh
And I know I should look after my mental health
