No static, all love
(The early hours ain't pretty. What about doing music full of regalia ready the world , at least my home? Generally happy, and you're partly to blame. I hear you loud and clear. All love, no static.)
I hear you loud and clear, it's all love
The mornings are getting harder
The stories are getting old
I hear you loud and clear, it's alright
And now I'm getting sick and tired
(My love)
But I've been getting on myself quite well
I can do it without (my love)
I caught my reflection in the water
I'm getting fed up with being fed up, oh no
Asking when are you gonna save me (my love)
No static, all love (my love)
I'm showing wear and tear, oh
I'll take control, I swear (my love)
And like wine, they stain the floor
And my nights, they aren't so pure no more
Looking in the mirror
No static, I, I
Of getting sick and tired again
No panic, I, I
No static, all love (my love, oh)
I won't panic, won't break down (my love)
