Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
Burning solid, burning thin, the burning rim
Like the stars burning holes right through the dark
And you said it was like fire around the brim
Sleepyhead, ooo
My beard grew to the floor and out the door
(Everything is going to the beat
I drag you back
They crowd your bedroom like some thought wearing thin
Everything is going to the beat
Everything is going to the beat)
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
And out your eyes, begonia skies
