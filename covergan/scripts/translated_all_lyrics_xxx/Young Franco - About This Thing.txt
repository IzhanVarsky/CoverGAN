I just come here to (smash) someone
Yeah, so what you know about this ting
Baseline bangs from here to Newcross
Call me king kinda like Luther
Cause it's bombai when the baseline drops
Yeah, what you know about this ting, what you know about this ting
When I come through I make the bass go (whoop)
Yeah, (whoop whoop whoop)
Pull up in the club came in the uber
Step out, you know I be the creme de la creme
Tell it from the start I'ma tell it from the jump
I ain't gonna lie and I ain't gotta front
Little rascal like dizzy in the ends
Here I come here I come
Call for the ting I got
This one free nizzle in the sound system
King for the good vibe like Luda
(And it goes like)
Who's hot who's not
What you know about this ting
Here I (huh)
Yeah, what you know about this ting
Flip modes switch flows where'd you get that from
Hold up
Here I come, here I come
Can't have none if you ain't lost one
Can't have one if you ain't lost none
Now its time for somethin' you love
I just come here to show some love
Rude boy really better make that chit chat stop (Whoop)
Came with the boom box on the rooftop
FWW yeah they call me the dun
New drops got the crew hot on the new block
Sky walking kinda like Lucas
Big big poppa bear call me the dun
(Whoop, whoop, whoop)
Busy with the flow and I be busy with the pen
Still hot steppin' in my air max ones
Come out the way when I shot this, shot this
Hey send a friend to a friend
