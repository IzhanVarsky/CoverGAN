All your love on me
That brings me right up to your spot
I trip when I kiss your lips
Cause I'm always thinking of ya
You feel all that I give

So we can lay back and smoke up
That's just how you're 'sposed to
Drop your love on me
I go hop on the bus
Cause you taste just like mimosas
Make sure that you roll one up
I almost missed the bus
You go and roll one up
That's just how you
