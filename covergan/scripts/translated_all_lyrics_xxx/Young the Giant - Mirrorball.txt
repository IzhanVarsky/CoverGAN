Hiding in the dark
Spinning out of control
You're all I see
Living in the past
Go on, tear me apart
Am I a ghost?
I finally figured out
(we are the ghost)
Looking for some action...
Time is lost
The world is round
Through my mirrorball
The wait is over now
It's over now
I know I have made mistakes
Mirror ball
Can't fall asleep
Opposite attraction
And I told ya, I told ya I know...
And heavy in my mouth
Look into the glass
Cuz I told ya!
Give me something to hold
Everybody has reason to fall
The world is small
Told ya I know
