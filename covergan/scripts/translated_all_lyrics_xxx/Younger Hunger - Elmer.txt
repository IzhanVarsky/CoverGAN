That I am someone worthy of trush
You're worse than meth
(Oooh) Why you hide me from your girl friends?
Only wanna break my heart
But it wasn't enough
You made me lose my way
Why you gotta go in the middle of vacation?
Part of me's deceasin' to you
I should've known from the start
But that's just a waste of time
Everything I stand for is out the door
I wanna stick to you like Elmer's glue
I'm staring to believe them
Guess our secret's hard to keep when
I never wanna be apart
What was it even for?
I'll save my breath
We both got a lotta getting even to do
I just wanna make you mine
I told you that I'd leave her
But only if you leave his punk ass in the dirt
You owe it to us both
Girl I gave you my love
So when you say you're sick of me and leavin'
Like I hide you from my girlfriend you
I told you that I love you
Just an explanation
Every single lie I told her about us
You and I are barely even work friends
You wanna be with me for the time being
