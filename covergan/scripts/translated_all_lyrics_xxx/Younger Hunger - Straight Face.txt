You're sweet like a lemonade
I'm addicted to your face
So mosey your way down to Norma's Double R Diner, where the juice is cold, but the coffee's always hot
I wanna hold you on a cold day
You know that I can't keep a straight face
Plus I got problems that are hard to hide (to hide)
And touch your face
Just one taste and I'm far away (away)
I don't wanna waste your time
I've got no money and I'm dead inside
I wanna kiss your neck
Medicine for a foggy day
Falling your way
You know I'm falling fast
(I don't smile enough) (enough)
I can't keep a straight face
(But the second you show up)
Just one taste is enough
You're the kind that I always crave
But the second you show up
I don't smile enough (enough)
