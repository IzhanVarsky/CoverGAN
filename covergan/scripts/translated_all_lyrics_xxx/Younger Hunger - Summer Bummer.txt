Just things I do not deserve
(Summer)
I could work harder
I can't run away
And all my furniture
Safe from me
Thoughts getting darker
No one
I burn my calendar
Over and over again
Wake up in summer
Everything's a bummer
Before I break my limit
How could I be ?
I gotta breathe a second
Without you babe
Is really a friend
Tomorrow the world will be
But these days
(Bummer)
So many things left to do
I think I need a minute
