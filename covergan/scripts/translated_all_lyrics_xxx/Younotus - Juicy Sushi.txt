You don't like it fried
I'm crying at the party
That's fine
'Cause you like wasabi
You're on a diet
But what about the sides?
Ah, alright (Yeah)
Make me go drown
Inside out, you're salmon trout
Oops, got no bikini
J–J–J–Juicy sushi
Juicy sushi inside out
Baby, you're down
Ah, alright (I don't–)
Just let me be your sides (Alright)
J-J-J-Juicy sushi
I–I'm no beginner
You and me in my (Jacuzzi)
That's fine (That's fine)
Juicy sushi
You and me in my jacuzzi
My tongue roll like ginger
Just, just like sashimi
