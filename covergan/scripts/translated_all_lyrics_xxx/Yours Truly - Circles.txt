What makes me different to you?
Can you explain it?
Don't blame it on your design
Yeah, frankly, I'm just sick of it
Don't think you should get used to this
And I'm over it
You need to stop and just let it go
Not gonna listen when you pretend to compromise
Haven't you heard the news?
(And don't say that "we gotta get over it")
You knew it, you messed up
And everything to prove
Oh, I fail to see these so called changes
We just go in circles
What's inside your head?
So let me know if you're hearing this
We're all apart of the fight
No need to patronize
I got nothing to lose
The way you act ain't right
Let me assure you, I'm serious
Don't say you're mislead
Just seems a little ridiculous
Oh, give me faith in how you're changing
Don't cut me off, don't call me "Miss"
When the way you act ain't right
It's time to change your views
