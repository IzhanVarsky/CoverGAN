Spiral in your atmosphere
And I swear you'll see it bloom
Searching for blue butterflies
Let it strip you of the things
And hope it never fades, it still gets dark
While you're swimming in pools (While you're swimming in pools)
We're just swimming in pools
Just like storm water
Gets dark
Hold your virtues now
Treading undersize
This is a reminder
Searching for blue butterflies (Searching for blue butterflies)
Try to stay afloat (Try to stay afloat)
I swear you'll see it bloom
Can you take things slowly?
Nothing grows overnight
But there's still light from the moon
Our waterways don't always flow the same
Hold your virtues now (Hold your virtues now)
Cover yourself in the wind, it's closing in
(Never the same, never the same)
And don't you drown, I'm counting on
While you're swimming in pools
It may take some time
You can't stare at the sun
Oh, down the drain, wash it away
Seeing you get wiser
Try to stay afloat
The same
Find an ivory tower
And when the tide's too hard to bear
You wish you didn't notice (Didn't notice)
