You're a world away
The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
So I shut my mouth
And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
Somewhere in the crowd
You're the only, you're the only
But don't you dare ask me how I've been
World away
You're the only one who can up and run
In the palm of your hands you can make me dance
And lonely
So won't you tell me, babe
You keep on talking sweet till your fingers bleed
Now only you know the strength of your teeth
In a foreign place
You're the only one who can
Spin me around in circles till I'm wrapped in string
There's nothing left to say
And only you know the strength of your teeth
Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain
Leave me just as empty as the day you came
Are you happy now?
