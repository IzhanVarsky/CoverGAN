I'm tired of the hint
The uncomfortable
It's because of your skin
‘Not helpful (Helpful)
(One two)
Why did you suddenly disappear?
Youre my friend?
In your sleep?
There is another sita included
‘Don’t
Waste
In your sleep
Of tears in the raw fool
Give me a friend
Dila
Left alone
I don't like that (I don't like you either)
Oh oh don't hesitate
The call to
You can't blame me
That's right
I thought
Nothing is accomplished
I need that
‘I won’t do that
Diba?
Whispering disturbing
The restless
Giving your order
Just cover your mouth
Or do you know?
Umasta
Not just
Oh, you know?
Oh, come closer to me
