Wrapped in silent elegance
As illusions burst
Sink in the city aquarium
Make me somewhere I can call a home
'Cause lately Iâ€™ve been losing on my own
Too late to learn from experience
Cause lately I've been losing on my own
Searching the neon lights
Beautifully broken down
Too late to wonder how
Sing in the key of night
Take me somewhere we can be alone
To finish first
Lost in cheap delirium
As they're watching me
I move carefully
Won't you take me home?
