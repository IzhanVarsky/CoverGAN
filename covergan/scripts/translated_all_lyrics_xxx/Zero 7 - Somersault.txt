You're obsessed with hiding the sticks and stones
When I fear the unknown
You talk to loners, you ask how's your week
You put my feet back on the ground
You were sweet and you were sound
You're the warmth in my summer breeze
You feed other people's parking meters
You encourage the eating of ice cream
You feel like home, you feel like home
You're the ivory to my ebony keys
You would somersault in sand with me
You saved me
You would share your last jelly bean
Did you know you brought me around
You're the prince to my ballerina
You give love to all and give love to me
