You, who live in my mind, you
you already have another
You, what a way to hold on, you
You already forgot me
and you already forgot me
You, crying on the platform
You, in every corner, you
And you already have another
I'm falling apart from your absence
you have another
you stuck to the wall
you already forgot me, uh
your look in the rear view mirror
And the worst thing is that I never want to see you
You, who orbit me like the Sun
You under the tablecloth
You in the blue dress
I'm sinking into the habit of loving you
you already forgot me, oh
