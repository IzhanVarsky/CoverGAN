A fragrance of pain made me touch that which was immutable, uuh
The light of my being, morning star
Oh my sunshine, I won't give up
Horror love, deep mistake to have fallen prey to fear
What loneliness, damn anxiety
All that I was stays here
Love horror, human error to have fallen into temptation
Songs of love, of compassion
Beautiful woman, morning star
Oh my sun, I feel like dying
Oh, my sun, and I'm not going to give up
It is not vanity of spirit
I miss you
With the membranes of your smell I built myself castles of revenge
Tranquility, vulnerability
I dug furiously into the pillow, looking for traces of a beautiful childhood, uuh
I always tried to give you the best
And I restarted my heart to see if I could love myself again
Bizarre misanthrope, rhetoric of fragile youth
A magical glow rests on my dunghill of the eardrum
With your colored smiles, I painted melodies in the air
It will be the dark night of the soul
I erased my personal history with a dimensional fan
It will be the path that leads me to you
So far from me, nothing is forever
I have to fight for the hope of love
Flashes of light, hellish sadness
It was always you
But I'm a complete idiot
