Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna
¡Oye, Wachito!
What do you mean?
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
Nos tenemo' que ir
Are you serious?
(Are you really sure you don't wanna come with us?)
(It's getting late) But I'm not nearly done
I'm putting my foot down, I'm staying here
You wanna go home, but I just wanna have fun
Yeah
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
¿Qué?
¿En serio? Pero la estaba pasando bien po, quédense un poco más po hueón
Si pue', Brayan está bien cansado
Dime
There's way too many reasons to stay here
Yapo
You can't possibly be meaning the words that come out of your mouth
Ah, tranqui, quédate
¿Se van ahora, al tiro?
No me quiero ir
The truth is that I don't wanna stay without you
You say that you're tired and want me to calm down
(I miss my bed) Let's hang out, come on
And if we go, we'll miss it all
I'm sleepy too, I promise this will be worth it
Just 'cause you want to, I don't think that it's fair
I was shy at first, but they welcomed me
Are you leaving now?
