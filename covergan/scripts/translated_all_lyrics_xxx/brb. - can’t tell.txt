And now I guess I'm going solo
I can't even tell she's gone
You can keep all your commotion
It's not a dream not a delusion
Been wasting all that to devotion oh
There is no us that is a no go
Someone you know from recollection
The writings on the walls
I'm cashing short of all the notions
Knife cold, she knows, I can tell she's kryptonite
Is this a dream or just delusion, shit
Don't say it anymore, yeah
No echoes in the hall
Can't hear them anymore no
I can't deal with no emotion
I been around yeah did I mention?
Lost in her dose but I'm getting out tonight
