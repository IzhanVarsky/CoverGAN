Thought you should know
You call it love, call it lust infatuation
Running wild on fantasy
You got everything I want
Within her rhymes if I could find a me
If you’re gonna be cool with it, cool it
Girl you should know
You got me hanging in the safe zone
Maybe even get you in the sheets now
Watching from the window on the street
You see, I'm higher then I've been before
Cause I'm everything you need
No one else that’s on my mind
No one else that's on my mind
Takin it slow
Picture perfect if we're meant to be
We'll start a coalition based on what you're feeling and I
Maybe even get you all alone
It could be love or just a fantasy
You can tell me on your own
I could be cool with it, cool with it
No I can’t even comprehend if I can defend my position
The things that don't belong
I know it's tough to make a revelation of the things that are going on
We'll take it step at a time cause I’ll always be stuck on your mind
It's just me and you tonight
I'm not used to this tranquility Yeah
She's always writing, could be poetry
I could get you on the phone
You can take your time but hey no reservation and I
Caught in loops I can't ignore
What you want and maybe what you don't
We could be cool with it, cool with it
