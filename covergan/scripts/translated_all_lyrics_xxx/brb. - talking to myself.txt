Feel like nothings better
I know we got together and forever but
Hands around your waist
I can’t make magic
So let us all fall into consensus
Late nights have got me feeling
Eyes closed for a minute
You know I can't stop thinking
I can't live without her
A compromise yeah I know it's true
All the ones know I can’t do
Like I should keep on listening
Taken for granted
To the streets turn out the heat
Can’t say its over
Just so you know
Feels right now in it
Can't say its over
About how you keep on missing
I can't make magic
Remember how we used to
Keep talking to myself lately
Lover and I
I mean we can pretend
With right and wrong we'll find our fixes oh
What’s not me what I could be
Gotta find a way to make it work without
Walked to your doorstep thinking
Real talk, no gimmicks
Yeah she's a witch
But I'm benevolent
