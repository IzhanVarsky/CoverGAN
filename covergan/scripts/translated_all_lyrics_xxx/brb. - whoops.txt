Don't wanna keep on trying
Wanna keep drinking you up
Running through my mind damn you so refined
Yeah yeah yeah
Like maybe you're that one thing
Girl you got me drunk and I can't help it
You got me thinking it's not right yeah yeah
(Whoops)
Don't need the one thing
What was in it?
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Dirty or not yeah you got it
Keep it coming cause I want you in my cup
It might be worth the wait
Must've been that drink that you gave to me
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh no, and now I'm just your prey
I can't tell you lies even if I tried
You got me feeling
But honestly it could've been the right thing
And now I can't tell left from right yeah yeah
You got me right where you want me
Got me sipping on that dirty cup
It could've been for nothing
