Gave back just so you know
I ain't wanna believe a damn thing about you
I been so caught up how can I stay
They say don't go she tore my heart into two
You was reckless when we met and I fucked with it
Heartbeat felt like thunder
Thinking about your lips on my face
I was pulled right under
Ey ey
Mmh mmmh
With a heart made out of stone
Fuck
Retrace my steps and you done did it
I ain't been sober since last month
Hey dear tell me are you cold
If I fade
Wish I never made you mine oh
Would you even notice if I fade
Might as well start how you ended
All these red roses that I slay
Falling into each other
And place on your bedside when I stray
We were falling under
I don't wanna know a thing about you
Oh I been up so late baby so late
Shorty you done wasted my time
Got me so turnt up
Wavy feeling so wavy
Lost in a feel when I sent it
Nothing like saying I lover her
