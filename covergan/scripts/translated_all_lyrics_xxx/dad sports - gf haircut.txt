Smile with my eyes, this song is done, our locks are wound
(Write a song about it)
Hey, I talk too much
Hey, don't cut too much
(I don't wanna be stuck with your overgrown haircut)
I like your hair but it's getting kinda long and I think
I hope it's not too late to talk about it now
When I have the time I could maybe write song about it
I hand the scissors, I'll really try to keep it together
I won't look 'cause it's scarier than I remember
Is it my hair? Is it a problem? Do you wanna cut it?
But I don't want it cut by anybody else
It's just like Pavement when they wrote that song about this (Stop it)
I hope it's not too late to talk about us now
I don't wanna be stuck with your girlfriend haircut
Some things go wrong but it's better not think about it
I won't look 'til you tell me that it's over
These strands are falling one by one onto the ground
When I hand the scissors it's a promise that we'll stick together
Don't you think the weather's been kinda off lately?
I'll tag along like a scary movie that you're watching
I really hope that I'm not driving you crazy
