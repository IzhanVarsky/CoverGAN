And you still see me too
In a year or two?
But I'll still leave without a sound
Wonder how she's been here before
He said it's all inside your head
Calm down and fall back 'til you're dead
It's almost like this isn't real
In a day or two
Why do I never feel?
But I still see you so
Christie is running through your door
Will I still be around for you
