Doesn't it seem like so much to think
Follow the feeling, say what you're meaning
Out for a breather, sit in the dark
Brushing the wind, so caught in the ties
Do you know my name
Said you didn't have a choice
Maybe I'll have you over
Maybe she likes me that way
Never complacent, always redundant
Maybe after school
Held on the stakes I'm slipping away
What we would look like face to the stars
Do you wanna hang
To ever make it matter
Carrie said that we don't have the time
Blushing away, so caught in your eyes
Aren't you tired of my voice
I think you're kinda cool
Caught by her gaze, not turning away
Someday I'll have you wonder
She'll never like me that way
Wondering what she's thinking
