I have learnt to sleep on the clouds
On the other side I'll be singing
Infinite beside
As if I'm lost, I'll be fine
And everything ends inside
Take me for a ride
All my life (infinite beside)
Well beyond the night, and past the sun
And I've become lost in time
'Cause I've been lost all my life
I can finally breathe under water
'Cause I've been lost
All my life (take me for a ride)
It's far beyond open skies
