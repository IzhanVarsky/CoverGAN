Let me wrap you in with my skin
Two queens in a king-sized bed
With my skin
And then I want them all
All my time is yours to spend
Like angels in the snow
The closer, the better it gets
But I'll kiss you anyway
So let's stay right here
On Christmas day
Two queens in a king-sized bed (Hmm)
Yeah, I'll kiss you anyway
Your freckled cheeks, our tangled feet
I don't have a lot to give
Until forever disappears
But I would give you everything
There's no mistletoe above our heads
My only wish is one more year
