You can be my girl but we ain't getting married
She said I'm a savage, so I let her have it
When I'm gone, will you miss me? Gone, will you miss me?
Take a trip to Paris, make her feel careless
Every time we speak, you speak in tongues, I run in place
I might have to block you, know it's for the better
Love is just a sweet mistake we make, could give you all
Out of bounds I've been drifting, bounds I've been drifting
In the air, it makes me sick, and I can taste it now
I been glued to my bed, too much shit inside my head
Feeling so foolish
But I've been reflecting, I'm losing the best thing
Off these pills, off these drugs, so much stress, when's enough
Regret it all when I do it
Playboy bunny ice her out with karats
Feeling so stupid
Left your lipstick stain on my sweater
I can't sleep, I just weep, drown in whiskey that ain't cheap
Why I'm fucking with you, bitch?
For the better, for the better
Couldn't give a fuck if I lose this
But how much will it take? Oh, how much will it take?
Lips taste sweet like candy
All this time that I've wasted how?
So why do I do it? Emotionally clueless
And I don't really know nothing better
This ain't new, I been through this
Close my eyes, I see your face
This love won't last never ever
Trust me, don't wanna forget you, no
Hold my breath, need some peace, need some love
