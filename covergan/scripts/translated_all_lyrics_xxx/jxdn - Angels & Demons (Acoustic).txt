On a trip, no train
And all these angels and demons
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Took another line, I'm calling
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
Black, white, left, right, yeah
I don't feel the same
Oh oh oh
I'm falling from Eden
Tell my sins to go
No one in the world can help me out
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Oh oh
I don't really think it's a problem
I'm fallin' from Eden
One gunshot could solve 'em
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
Tell my friends I'm sorry though
Everybody said that I'm falling
No one in the world can stop me now
Don't forget my name
Up, down, all night, yeah
Can't escape it ever
Me plus me is a problem
I don't really think I'm the problem
Two face, two face, yeah
I'ma dive into the mosh pit
I'm so sick of the nonsense
Oh oh oh oh oh
