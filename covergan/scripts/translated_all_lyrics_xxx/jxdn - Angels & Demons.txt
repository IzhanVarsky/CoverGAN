On a trip, no train
And all these angels and demons
Took another line, I'm calling, uh
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit, uh
Black, white, left, right, yeah
I don't feel the same
Fucked up like a rock star, riding in a cop car
I'm falling from Eden
Nothing in the world can stop me now
No one in the world can help me out
I don't really think it's a problem
So fuck me like a rock star, dancing on a cop car
(Rock star)
I'm fallin' from Eden
One gunshot could solve 'em
T-t-t-tell my sins to go
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
Don't forget my name
Up, down, all night, yeah
Can't escape it ever
Me plus me is a problem
(Rock star, rock star)
I don't really think I'm the problem
Two face, two face, yeah
Everybody said that I'm falling, uh
Tell my friends I'm sorry, though
(Fuck me like a rock star)
