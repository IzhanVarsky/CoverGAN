Hey, forgot that's when it started, back when it started
(Hadn't thought of that, I hadn't thought of that, yeah)
Mine, for the rest of the time
Hey, one sec, I gotta call you back

Oh, so you said hadn't thought of that

(At my heart like that, had my heart like that, yeah)
I've got nowhere else to be now
But you're ignoring me
Hey, forgot that's when it started
