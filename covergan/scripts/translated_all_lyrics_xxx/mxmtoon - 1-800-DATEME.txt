I can't deny
Please date me!
Oh guy after guy
I don't like to mingle
I prefer Netflix over everyone (I'm so Tumblr! Hashtag relatable.)
It's Valentine's Day
Never really figured it out with someone
Wow lucky to be
I'm quick to gush
Crush after crush
I'll be my own valentine, it's fine
Mmmmmm, mmmm, mm mm
Oh my God wow I'm so lonely
But it never works out so I'm done
But it's better this way
Even though I cry, I'm not in a rush
My own valentine
Sorry, sorry, back to the song
And I'm lonely and single
I'll be my own valentine
I never really figured it out with someone
Guy after guy
