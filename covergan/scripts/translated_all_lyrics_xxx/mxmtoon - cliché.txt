What’s your name? I’d really like to know about you"
I didn’t wanna fall but then I stepped right in
It felt like just one big whirlwind
But maybe it’s better this way
You looked me in the eye
I wanted to be with you (And only with you)
Oh, no one could compete (No one could compete)
How was your day?”
You swept me off my feet
Mmmh, woah
Oh my god, I think I’m dying!
And looked right back
I looked up at your face
Oh, what a cliché, but it, to be honest, it made my day
Too bad I stopped at “Hello”
And then I felt it right within
You said “Hey”
And that’s all we were
But that’s okay!
We clicked like Legos
It was too late for me (Too late for her)
I just stared
A silly cliché
With every single word I started falling farther
A little cliché
But I wouldn’t have it any other way (Any other way)
You said “Yeah I do
And that’s what we were
One big emotional whirlwind
Or the clacking of tap shoes
You took a step forward and tilted your head
A simple cliché
Bah duh duh dum
Swept me off my feet
With a curious glance, you stared
Over the next few days, we got to talking
You said “Better now”, with a smile
It wasn’t made to work
Mmmh
I looked down at the ground
I said, “Hello, I gotta know, do you feel this way?”
I said “Hello
Bah duh duh duh duh dum
That’s okay
You made me laugh, you made me blush
But I was scared of what you might say”
Farther and farther for you
And then I wanted to erase myself
We’re just a little cliché
It seemed too good to be true (It was too good to be true)
It was too late for me
And you grinned
I didn’t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in
And I said “Hello
No one could compete (No one could compete)
You were so witty and so charming
And I felt dead
I still think you’re cute
I walked into the room and then I saw your face
And those eyes, they drew me in
Erase myself
