I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
I'm happy for you, I'm smiling for you
So I'll keep it inside and bury it deep
I need to let go and I swear that I've tried
Keeping my feelings hidden, there is no ease
But opening up means trusting others
And I need it to stop so let me tell you, please
I need it to stop and I want to be able to open up
My feelings are fatal
But my feelings are fatal, my feelings are fatal
I'd do anything for you, for you
I know it’s not healthy but you won’t hear a peep
Closed doors, locked in, no keys
I could never tell you that I'm breaking slowly
Though I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
It’s always for you and never for me
But I can’t tell you that I'm breaking slowly
How many times must I keep it inside
And that’s just too much, I don’t want to bother
