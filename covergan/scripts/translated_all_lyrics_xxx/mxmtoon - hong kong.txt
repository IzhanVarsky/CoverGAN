My memories, they feel so vivid
Maybe one day you'll see them again
Don't it feel so unfair
Hong Kong is moving around you
A home away from home
Yellow cars and smoggy skies
And dim sum was always fun
You left it behind you there
Your family is moving without you
Line the skyline with much power
It feels like I'm losing track of time
Your family is living without you
With neon lights that attract your eyes
All the way across the sea
Maybe one day you'll see
Yet, oh, so far away
You're missing a piece of yourself
But you can't help and drop your jaw
I don't know when I'll be back
That your family is living without you
Late nights were alright
Red brick and bamboo towers
Hong Kong is moving without you
And my memories will slowly fade away
Been years since I've been back
No matter how much you plea
Yet so much time has passed
Oh, just eat more and don't be rude
You can't help but stand there in awe
Big family with too much food
My memories will slowly fade away
