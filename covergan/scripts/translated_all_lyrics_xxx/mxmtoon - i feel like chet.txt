It’s really bad, I fall too hard
But I don’t talk and I don’t chat
One simple chat, I’ve got no guard
Molding stories out of clay
Thinking about how someday my someone will come along
But I can’t help that I like to think
I feel like Chet, but I won’t chat
Though my glasses are tinted rose pink
I’d like to believe that something could happen with me
I live on dreams above the clouds
And knowing that it’s all for play
I just lay awake hoping I’ll find the key
It’s all for play
(My glasses are tinted rose pink)
Oh, isn’t that cheesy, oh, isn’t that cheesy
Creating crushes out of crowds
(Ooo-ooo-oooo-ooo-oooh)
I feel like Chet but I won’t chat
I sit around all day just listening to love songs
I feel like Chet, it’s way too easy falling in love
No, not with you 'cause it’d fall flat
I’m a hopeless romantic afraid of commitment
