Maybe we knew that from the start
It wasn't meant to bе
I had to go, I'm sorry
I could use a friend (A friend, yeah)
My life isn't so cold
So I can comprehend
To gain some confidence
It wasn't meant to be
You can find how to be okay on your own
I need some time to myself
I'm not so scared to admit
You know it's not the end
To gain some confidence (Ooh)
I can't complete you, baby
Ooh
Just forming out a whole
And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
I couldn't be your half
Another confidant
But now that it's all over
I just can't be the one that makes you feel at home
But your story can not start until you've grown
I hope you'll understand
That even though it's over
I just want a hand to hold
I could use a friend, a friend, yeah
Find solace in your soul
Thought that I'd feel empty
'Til I can fall again
Maybe we knew that from thе start
I could use a friend
But I'll hold you in my heart
