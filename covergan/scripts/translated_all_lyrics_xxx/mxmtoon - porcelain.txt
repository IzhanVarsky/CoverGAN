And I am made of porcelain
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
My inner demons, they always win
Because they say what's inside is what really matters
They line my body and caress my face
But I really can't seem to ignore
Stretches and patches corrupt my flesh
With spotty freckle stars and no sense of gravity
But even with the good
So many things that I've come to hate
With marks and lines, it makes me feel weary
My skin is a story
Like a china tea cup with dried out glue
It makes me feel like I am weak and battered
My appearance dictate how much I fret
Over and over again
The bad feels so much stronger
And in my mind they saunter
Oooooo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo
Slowly eating away any confidence that's left
I look okay but I am breaking down
Cracking now and then, it wears me down
I feel so frail and empty too
I am made of porcelain
My face is like a galaxy
Oh, over and over again
The parts of me that I abhor
Oo-oo-oooo
And I really wish I wouldn't let
I'm cracking now and then, it wears me down
