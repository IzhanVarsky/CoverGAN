I don't care about others anymore
Let's get irresistible and jump out
Burning inochimijikashi
Even if the landing on the moon is uneven
Beloved fools
Let's escape tonight
Postpone what to do
Adults who can't get hooked are boring
Returning to outer space
Crazy night is not enough just for correctness
Like a lie You take my breath away
Let's turn our eyes and kiss
Space key with one click
Making love if you jump over one square
The night when the red thread was entwined as if it started from ,,
You are my amai darling
You take my breath away like the universe
Go beyond the atmosphere
You are me and you are me
With thoughts that made me Freeze
Skip boring scenes
Suddenly when the blue and round globe overflows
I don't want love that fits in
Plus perfection
Run run rendezvous
Let's make a satellite for only two people
Relative velocity becomes
Unpredictable
