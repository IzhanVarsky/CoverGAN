And you can try all you want to convince me
I'm better off alone (Yeah)
Until you came around asking for help
Something more something more
I'm better off alone
You know I really don't mind being alone
But I'm better off alone
That I need something more
And when I do I keep my headphones on
Something more, something more
It's been a couple days since I've left home
I've gotten used to dinner with my phone
I was feeling good all by myself
I really don't mind being alone
