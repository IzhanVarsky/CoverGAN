The music’s getting louder and I feel like this is a party
But it’s all up to you
Now I don’t know what you came here to do
You’ll never be too cool to dance
If you want to you can take my hand
And if you don’t know really you should get a clue
Get up and get loose
You only move a muscle when you sip on your Bacardi
(And everybody knows that)
Just step into my shoes
Just come a bit closer now
I can make you groove
You’ll never be too cool to kick it
If you’re feeling kinda nervous well then baby you’re invited
I see you standing in the corner looking for somebody
Now watch you move
And lemme show you how
And I know you want to
To come to you
Like I wouldn’t understand, but I do
(show you how)
