I can't take my shoulders again, yeah
A cool real man, sometimes you would want it
Tell me why am I so damn nerdy
Hurry up to pick you up now
How to kiss until your hair turns white
I wish I really could change for the better
It's sunny after the rain
If you can't stop being you
The main character in this drama, yeah
hot like a fire
friend's boyfriend
I want to show you a burning love but
Maybe your every day is your consideration for the pathetic me
I don't understand, why the hell
I've been feeling like a huge nerd lately
I hate being a nice guy, yeah)
very occasionally you
But I can't stop being so damn nerdy
Love isn't like that, stupid
It's big enough to be carried on my back
Saying I like you, the yellow sunset
I'm just happy because it's you
I wake up to the sound of the alarm bell
I just hope not to do it, only regret
(Can you love me, love me, love me, love me baby)
never hugged you
Dress up the clothes you picked yesterday
Why do you look at me like this
Do you smile when you look at me like that?
not manly
'Cause we're special you and I
I'll just be a nerd for you too
The two of us together last week
in a crowded subway
You know I'll be happy to see you like this
I'm just modest, I don't know, maker, I
I want to be a wonderful lover
Can't stop being so damn nerdy
I've been losing sleep for you, yeah
(I'm a nice guy, yeah
I can't sleep these days, every night
I don't really know baby
It's not nerdy boy, it's you just sweet babe
Looking at you who clicked like on a photo like that
My feelings are free for you
I don't have
Yeah I know you'll be compared
