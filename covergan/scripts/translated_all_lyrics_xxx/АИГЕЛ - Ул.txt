I will not break, I will not break, I will not subdue -
He is free, he is a wing, he is bleeding (new blood, new day!)
My father is myself
Your grandmother is growing up:
Creates, develops, breaks
The old world is over
It's a fire, it's a fire, it's a storm, it's a storm
- Good
I'm new here
I fly over the old world -
A little lock on the door
He is born tomorrow - who is he, who is he?
(new blood, new day)
Try, obey, bless, obey
Growing up, the giant is growing
I'm on fire
I am the king
I am new
The branches of the fire will grow and hug you, mother:
The roots of the fire extend to the sulfur soils
Born tomorrow
Hi, Dad
Only a burnt house does not need a lock
Fear lies - the child falls
Yana cup, around hot
Fly, burn wings, burn your pair of wings
Who is he, who is he? "She was born tomorrow."
Yana-yana, my soul is burning, my soul is burning, my soul is burning
Who is he
I do not break, I do not break, I do not obey - I burn side by side
That's it, that's it
Passing through the earth to a black shadow -
(Who is he, who is he? Who is he, who is he?)
"It's sand, it's dawn, it's quiet, it's straight, it's full."
And the bottom is a rotten cradle:
And one day no one breaks, does not harden, does not sink, does not obey
(Who is he, who is he?)
Hardens, sinks, subdues
She was born tomorrow
Dad, goodbye
Who is he, who is he? "He's your son."
Mom, Mom, Mom
Fire
It is a new language, it is a new knowledge, it is a new country -
Yana-yana, my soul burns, burns, burns my soul
It's a wing, it's a wing
I will be born tomorrow
Breaks-bu-bu-bu-bu-sub
Good
The leaf becomes the father-father
Here it is, a new day, a new ten;
It is said that you can fly like a bird only if you make your roots ashes
My mother
The flower becomes the parent
Fear the cradle
The giant is growing up
Fire, fire, spark, spark
He does not break, he does not obey
