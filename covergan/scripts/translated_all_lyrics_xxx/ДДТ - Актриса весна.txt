Grimly grumbles about shattered nerves, that there is no reason to warm
And, being baptized, opens the seventy-fifth theatrical season
In the patched tailcoats of the facades, the parterre of the house was filled
Dances poems about the cunning of heroes and the loyalty of rats
The applause of the streets painted the city sacred green
Actress Spring after a serious illness is back on stage:
Reads a ballet about nightmarish love and beautiful betrayal
Actress Vesna Actress Vesna
Let us live, let us sing until spring...
The incessant squeal of the squares lit up the galleries of lovers
Sun-Secretary General procrastinates lorgnette in the imperial box
Raises the smiles of passers-by by the chins
From this prayer the sky collapsed with an avalanche of heat
With a light movement fluttered onto the stage of the thawed roofs
