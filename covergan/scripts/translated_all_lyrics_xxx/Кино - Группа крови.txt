And there is something to pay, but I do not want
Victory at any cost
My serial number on the sleeve
Calls me on my way
Wish me luck in the fight, wish me
Stardust on boots
I don't want to put my foot on anyone's chest
Warm place, but the streets are waiting
Blood type on a sleeve
Don't stay in this grass
Easy chair, checkered plaid
Wish me luck, wish me luck
I would like to stay with you
just stay with you
But a star high in the sky
Trigger not pressed in time
Sunny day in dazzling dreams
Our footprints
