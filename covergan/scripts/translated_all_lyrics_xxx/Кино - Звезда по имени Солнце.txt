He does not remember any ranks or names
And two thousand years of war
anti-wrinkle medicine
Red-red blood
Stars named Sun
Three years later she is alive again.
A patchwork quilt on her
Except that this is a dream
And warmed by rays
And we know it's always been like this
And fall singed
Shutting down the heavenly light
And the clouds float above the city
A star called the sun
City in a road loop
War is the business of the young
War for no reason
On cracked earth
Who lives by the laws of others
And who should die young
He does not remember the word "Yes" and the word "No"
Lived under the light
After two, there are flowers and grass on it
The city is two thousand years old
And able to reach for the stars
What fate loves more
And yellow smoke over the city
An hour later it's just earth
White snow, gray ice
