Drink yourself with the wind
Satisfy your hunger with a song
Decorate your fingers with gold
Look for her and you will find
It's just a dance
Rings got dusty
If in your heart
Free your hands
And run faster
The dance will be light
Weave it in your hair
I'm sad tape
This is their first flight.
You won't fall
You will find her
Sunflare dance
Lost smile
