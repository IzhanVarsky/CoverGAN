Against those who drown in the swamp, have you seen who is in the top?
I'm sayin' get outta here!
You were raised just like your father
You won't even lift your ass: not King Arthur
He is my friend - where is yours? Gone for bread, how old? (Woah)
Now the whole room, as I knew, I'll roll it into asphalt, hey, kid
Tormenting cash on bread, I don't give a fuck about the brand, trout fishing (Woah)
We only differ in who uploads what information to the compartment
Facts are what I use when writing a line, bra
Koresh, come on for yourself without allegories
For real, I'm sayin' get outta here, for real!
My brothers are with me, my dad is cooking bechamel next to me (Wag!)
Torment cash on bread, fuck the brand (cash, cash, cash)
You need an example who will show them the dick that he brought from outside
Here the goal is to leave a story, something that will feed
Are you being dragged to the bottom? Don't pull and board
Comment - bro, is that all you can do?
I blame the beat, and every beat is a harpoon
My brothers are with me, my dad is cooking bechamel next to me
I don't believe you, you're a bad talker
Speak to the point, but do not shake the ground
Wag! Wag!
Forget about the word rest
I fly low like a lowrider and get up early for work like Dana White
You either want to but can't, or you can but don't want to.
I do not judge: there is the same moment - yet we are all, like everyone else
I move as I want - that is, as I can
Torment cash on bread, fuck the brand (cash, cash)
(Wag!)
I'm going to work, I don't make noise
Music visited me, but it didnâ€™t fill my belly, we are connected with it by bonds for centuries (Alright)
You want, but you can't, or you can, but you don't want to
Torment cash on bread, fuck the brand (cash)
If they want, they will find me
Sori, you and I do not live on repeat
You need an example who didn't do like everyone else to be stronger
Get outta here, man, shit, I'm sayin'!
