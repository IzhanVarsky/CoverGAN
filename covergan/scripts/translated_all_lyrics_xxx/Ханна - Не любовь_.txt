So that cortisol does not cover
Leaving my thousand calls unanswered
I will remember you one day
Now it doesn't matter
Morning coffee in bed
And choking on tears
That we are now completely strangers
I won't see them again
In my dream you stroked my fingers
And I'm completely naked
You played with me like a pro
Not knowing who was there before
Don't step into that river twice
I take wine and marshmallows
Rays play on the roofs
I'll swipe to the cart I'm a widget
And if you were not obedient, forgive me
Fortune telling for love
And why do you feel good in someone else's arms
I was waiting for you, but you didn't come
I go down to the store
How we burned those nights
I guess I didn't care
You won't come, you won't come, you won't come
And I did not understand what you found in them
Alarm clock about twenty times
You change them like gloves
What is there again for a small
Laughing like I'm sick
Throwing on an old hoodie
And brought like in a movie
With me you were so gentle
Night again, night again, night again
Maybe you forget me
Laughed on your air
How I hate you
And I did not understand, I could not forgive
Trains are leaving, there is an empty platform in the window
You, knowing, nevertheless decided - this is not love
I don't believe that
I'm under hypnosis, under the moon
And I don't have the strength to wake up
Huddled in your apartment
I'm wearing yesterday's dress
