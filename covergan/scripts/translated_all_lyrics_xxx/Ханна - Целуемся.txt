Cupids admire us and
You, you painted me from the inside
I'm ready for anything for love
The streets are smiling at us
But even if you are another mirage
Ready to be wrong at night hundreds of thousands of times
Your lips are like thorns
We have something to talk about
But I fall into them again, not noticing the wounds
But we just kiss
Why does everything feel like a dream again?
After all, we managed to do everything that was needed yesterday
Let's not rush anymore
